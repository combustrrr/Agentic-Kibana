"""Portability contract — nothing SHIPPED may hardcode one deployer's environment.

This suite is open source and is installed by many organisations. Anything that is
shaped by a particular environment — rule names, index names, field names, a SIEM
vendor, a threshold tuned to one data set — must be CONFIG or DERIVED, never baked
into shipped source or shipped content.

SCOPE, stated honestly: this is a source lint over the **backend source tree** and
the **bundled Markdown playbooks in ``backend/playbooks/``**. It does not inspect
the Web Console, the deploy manifests, `docs/`, or anything an operator authors at
runtime — operator-authored playbooks in a ``Preferences.playbooks.dir`` override
are *expected* to name that site's own detections and are deliberately out of scope.

It asserts **SHAPE, never vocabulary.** There is no blocklist of one operator's
proper nouns here, on purpose: such a list goes stale the moment that operator
renames something, and it would render a different verdict in a deployment that has
never heard of those systems. A shape assertion, by contrast, is meaningful
everywhere and stays true for any future catalog.

Distribution/packaging is a different contract and lives in
``tests/test_distribution_contract.py`` (it builds a wheel and runs a subprocess).
Keep this file fast and import-light.

#
# It rejects every shape a copied SIEM rule TITLE has — spaces, capitals, ``:``,
# ``|``, ``/``, parentheses — in ANY deployment, without naming a single product.
# ``-`` is accepted as an equivalent separator because the shipped SAMPLE rule
# catalog contains ``waf-nginx-access`` (see ``config._SAMPLE_EVENT_MODULES``): a
# hyphen is a perfectly portable slug character, and forcing a rename there would
# desynchronise the sample rule from the ``event.module`` literal it demonstrates.
#
# ONE grammar is not a convenience, it is a correctness requirement. A playbook's
# ``match.rule_ids`` and a ``RuleDefinition.name`` are the SAME namespace —
# ``models.RawEvent.from_hit`` sets ``rule = matched.name`` and
# ``playbooks.registry.select_playbook`` intersects ``rule_ids`` against exactly that
# value. Applying a stricter pattern to one end than the other would make this file
# contradict itself: it would certify ``waf-nginx-access`` as a portable seeded rule
# name while rejecting the bundled playbook that binds to it, and the failure message
# would then demand a rename the shipped catalog has already fixed.
