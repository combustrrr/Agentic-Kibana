"""Operator RESET service (Round 4, Wave 4 — the danger-zone endpoint's engine).

A **tiered, secret-safe** reset of the suite's OWN management state. Three scopes,
each a strict SUPERSET of the previous (see the tier table in
``docs/research/2026-07-round4/PROPOSAL.md`` §6.6):

* ``cases``    — clear the case store + the case-adjacent collaboration/observability
                 KV stores (campaigns, baseline sketches, noise-reduction counters,
                 inbox, case thread/activity/tasks, batch jobs) + the in-memory
                 live-tail rings. KEEP sources, settings, users, RAG, secrets, cost
                 ledger, audit.
* ``sources``  — the cases tier PLUS ``Preferences.sources[]`` (configured feeds) +
                 the polling cursors. KEEP secrets, users, settings, the ``setup``
                 flag.
* ``factory``  — the sources tier PLUS users/sessions/user-prefs/custom-roles/
                 proposals/memory + branding, resets prefs to defaults with
                 ``setup_complete=False`` (→ fresh OOBE), and (ONLY at this tier)
                 resets the append-only audit index. KEEP env-provided secrets.

⛔ HARD RULE (code-enforced): this service **NEVER reads or writes any env-provided
secret** — ``Secrets`` (``ES_API_KEY`` / the LLM keys / ``STATE_DB_URL`` / any
``TLSOC_*``) is the env/.env + in-memory tier and is never touched here. Reset only
ever re-initialises the StateStore side; it never rewrites env/.env. The per-source
connector secrets + wizard/in-memory secrets that DO clear at tiers 2/3 are cleared
by the ROUTE layer (which owns the in-memory ``Secrets`` object), NOT here — this
engine is a pure StateStore operation.

Invariants held (mirroring the platform rails):
  * #1 — never touches the read-only log surface / the upstream ``all-logs-*`` key.
    Every clear rides the ``_mgmt``/StateStore path (the case/audit indices, the KV
    doc store, the cursor index); the read-only ``_ro`` client is never used.
  * #3 — NEVER imports ``case_manager`` / calls ``decide()``. Reset destroys cases;
    it never TRANSITIONS one (no verdict, no close/escalate decision).
  * #4 — never recomputes a ``cluster_signature``.
  * #6 — the usage/cost ledger is preserved at the ``cases``/``sources`` tiers (cost
    history survives a case reset); only a FULL factory reset resets the audit index.
    No LLM call is made.

The cases and sources tiers remain best-effort. Factory reset is different: every
privacy-critical clear uses a confirmed strict write, later identity/audit/OOBE
steps stop after the first failure, and the caller receives an explicit failed
receipt. The Jobs runner keeps the factory fence until that boundary is confirmed,
so a partial clear is never presented as a clean new tenant.
