"""Noise-Reduction funnel — severity banding + rollup helpers (Round 7).

Turns the two ingest-side inputs of the Noise-Reduction funnel into the shared
5-band severity vocabulary and assembles the ``GET /api/metrics/noise-reduction``
report contract (§D of the Round-7 plan). Two responsibilities, both PURE:

1. **Banding** — project a raw source-asserted severity onto the canonical 5-band
   ladder by IMPORTING the single classifier authority in :mod:`app.engine.priority`
   (:func:`priority._severity_band_from_magnitude` + :func:`priority._normalise_severity`
   + :func:`priority.severity_scale_for_source`). The cut-points live ONLY in
   ``priority.py`` — this module never re-declares them (one place to tune 74/48/22/8).

2. **Rollup** — count raw events / clusters by band, and fuse the durable
   :class:`app.stores.noise_counters.NoiseCounterStore` window tally with a mutually
   exclusive case disposition tally plus additive operational views. Auto-cleared and
   Escalated partition opened cases; Closed by human overlaps Escalated as an
   analyst-attributed subset.

Everything here is DETERMINISTIC + advisory (#3): nothing is read by
``case_manager.decide()`` and no ``cluster_signature`` is recomputed (#4). Every helper is
defensive — a malformed event/case/counter degrades to a zero/``info`` band, never raises,
so a dashboard query can't fail and a poll tick can't break on the counters.
