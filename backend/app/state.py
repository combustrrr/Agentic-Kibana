"""Application state — the dependency-injection hub and lifecycle owner.

``AppState.create`` builds every component; in production it wires the real ES
client + real LLM gateway, and in tests it accepts an injected ES client and
provider overrides so the entire app runs in-process with no network.

``_wire`` is the single place all ES-derived components are (re)constructed, so a
wizard-driven credential change can re-point the whole graph at a fresh ES client
without a restart.

    It is INERT until Wave-4 calls it: constructing it opens no connection and reads no

    Ledger invariant (#6): result folding is delegated to

    verdict text into cases is the pipeline's job downstream.

    Provider acceptance and local provider-id persistence are not one transaction.
    The durable local outbox prevents duplicate submission on normal cursor replay,
