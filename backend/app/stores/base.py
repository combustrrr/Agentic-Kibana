"""Repository interfaces for the suite's OWN management state (Epoch A).

The suite's bookkeeping — cases, audit, usage, config, cursor and RAG vectors —
is persisted behind these abstract repositories so the SAME callers (pipeline,
chat, standup, poller, routes, state) work unchanged whether the backend is
Elasticsearch (the default) or a SQL database (SQLite for dev/test, PostgreSQL
+pgvector for production).

The method signatures here mirror the existing ES-backed stores EXACTLY, so the
ES classes (``CaseStore``/``AuditLogger``/``UsageStore``/``ConfigStore``/
``CursorStore``) already satisfy them — they simply declare the contract their
SQL counterparts (``SqlCaseRepository``/...) must reproduce.

Non-negotiable #2 (audit is append-only) is encoded in the interface: an audit
repository exposes ONLY ``write``/``record``/``records_for_case`` — there is no
update or delete on a recorded action, in any backend.

    Duck-typed on ``kv`` (anything exposing async ``get(ns, key)`` / ``put(ns,
    key, value)`` — the real ``KVStore`` subclasses AND the offline test fakes),
    so a store can route its mutations through this regardless of the concrete
    backend. The shared single-document KV stores (inbox, memory, case
    threads/activity/tasks, notif prefs, custom roles, price overlay, shift
    handoff, user prefs) all mutate ONE doc by load→mutate→save; two coroutines /
    processes that interleave that cycle silently drop one writer's change. This
    closes that WITHOUT a new index/column:

      1. the caller-owned ``lock`` (a per-store :class:`asyncio.Lock`) serialises
         writers in THIS process — the primary defence for the single-uvicorn
         deployment these stores target; and
      2. a ``_rev`` revision stamped INTO the value gives compare-and-set: each
         attempt re-reads, applies ``mutator`` to a FRESH snapshot and bumps
         ``_rev``; if the persisted ``_rev`` moved under us (a multi-process /
         multi-replica race the in-process lock can't see), the cycle retries on
         the new snapshot.

    ``mutator(current_value_or_None) -> new_value`` MUST be a pure function of its
    snapshot (it may run more than once). The fast path (no contention) is one
    get + one put + one verify-get — and the new value is byte-compatible with the
    old hand-rolled save except for the additive ``_rev`` bookkeeping key. NEVER
    raises: on a backend glitch / exhausted retries it logs and returns the last
    computed value so the store degrades rather than dropping the write.
