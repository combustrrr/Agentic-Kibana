    """Browse recent logs across ALL enabled, browse-capable sources at once.

    Fans out the EXACT per-source read that ``GET /sources/{id}/logs`` does — a bounded
    scoped read-only search per PULL source (via ``es_client_for_source`` so per-source
    TLS + mgmt-key-dropped, #1) and the live-tail buffer for each PUSH source — then
    merges the rows newest-first. Every row carries a MANDATORY ``source_id`` +
    ``source_name`` provenance column. Read-only, hard-capped, and secrets are never
    returned (rows are the same ``_log_row`` log-data shape).

    Resilient by design: each source runs under ``asyncio.wait_for`` and the whole set
    under ``gather(return_exceptions=True)``, so one slow or failing source degrades to
    a per-source error entry and NEVER blocks the rest (partial success).

    ``source_id`` (OPTIONAL) scopes the fan-out to exactly one source, mirroring the
    private preview reader in ``routes_rules._read_recent_events``. Omitting it is the
    byte-identical all-sources behaviour. A ``source_id`` that is not visible in the
    CURRENT mode is a 404 — while Demo Mode is active a real tenant id is
    indistinguishable from an unknown one, so demo isolation leaks nothing — and a
    visible id that is not an eligible browse target for this route (disabled, no
    registered connector, or no ``browse`` capability) is a 501, the same status and
    detail the per-source sibling route uses.

    Each per-source status entry carries ``mode``: ``"search"`` = a real backing search
    (``from``/``to``/``query`` apply) and ``"buffer"`` = a push source's process-local,
    volatile in-memory live-tail ring, where ``from``/``to``/``query`` are IGNORED and
    nothing survives a restart. Without it a caller cannot tell a time-ranged query from
    a ring read in the merged view. ``mode`` describes the FILTERS, not the durability
    of the backing store: a Demo Mode adapter reports ``"search"`` because it really
    does apply ``from``/``to``/``query``.

    BOUNDED, NOT COMPLETE. ``limit`` is clamped to 1..200 and applied per source AND on
    the merge; there is NO pagination, cursor, or offset. The envelope echoes the
    effective ``limit`` and a ``truncated`` flag so a caller can say "most recent N"
    rather than implying it has seen everything. Each per-source status carries its own
    ``truncated``, computed by the SAME ``_browse_truncated`` rule the per-source
    sibling route uses, and the envelope ``truncated`` is the OR of the merge being cut
    with any single source being cut — so scoping to one source, or running a
    single-source deployment, reports exactly what ``GET /sources/{id}/logs`` reports
    for that same read."""

    A queue that accumulated for a deployment's whole life cannot realistically be

    decision record each — rather than a bulk state write with a single summary row.

    Consequences of that choice, all deliberate:

    * **Idempotent.** An already-rejected id reports ``already_rejected`` and writes
      nothing new; ``record_strict`` deduplicates on ``event_id`` anyway.
    * **Partial success is a first-class result.** One unusable id — missing, in
      flight, or a store hiccup — is reported in ``results`` and never aborts the
      batch, so an operator is never left guessing which half landed.
    * **Bounded.** At most :data:`BULK_DECISION_LIMIT` ids per request, deduplicated,
      because each one performs a durable write.

    Expired proposals are rejectable, which is what makes this the queue-clearing tool.

#   * the SQL repository silently falls back to ``created_at``, which means it answers a
#     different question than it was asked and never says so.
#

# a sentinel, so an allow-list asserted only against it would pass offline and 400 in

# entry is a universal ``Case`` field that is sortably mapped in ``es/indices``
# ``CASES_MAPPING`` AND has a real ORDER BY expression in the SQL repository's
