"""Operator diagnostics: make the SILENT failures observable.

Every defect in the precedent/auto-close incident was silent. An operator changed an
unrelated setting, the precedent corpus collapsed, auto-close stopped forever, and the
only trace in the whole system was ``RAG seeded with 20 chunk(s)`` at INFO — a line
that reads exactly the same whether N is 2000 or 0. This router turns each of those
into a DIAGNOSABLE STATE an operator can actually see:

* **Precedent-corpus health** — corpus size, per-source chunk/document counts, the last
  projection's per-source before/after deltas (``RagService.last_projection``), and an
  explicit boolean for "0 analyst-confirmed precedents available". Paired with the
  analyst-confirmed ground truth actually present in the case history, so "nobody has
  graded anything" is distinguishable from "the projection is broken".
* **SQL schema-migration state** — ``stores.sql.engine.SCHEMA_MIGRATION_STATUS``. A
  ``failed`` state means privileged strict audit writes (proposal approve/reject) are
  broken; that must never be invisible.
* **Auto-close health** — the rolling rate from :func:`engine.metrics.auto_close_health`,
  which distinguishes an auto-close collapse from a quiet period.

Design notes:

* **Authenticated, RBAC-gated, and deliberately NOT on ``/api/health``.** That endpoint
  is public (the Console reads it before login), and publishing corpus counts, per-source
  detection posture and state-backend internals there would hand an anonymous caller a
  read on the deployment. This surface gates on the existing ``settings:read`` grant —
  the same read-only operator grant every built-in role already holds and the one an
  operator uses to diagnose configuration — following the ``routes_schedulers.py``
  precedent of picking the grant of the page that consumes the evidence.
* **Read-only over the corpus, with ONE bounded advisory write.** No LLM, no seeding
  and no projection mutation: the corpus is read through the seed-free
  ``snapshot_documents_strict`` seam, so merely *asking* about corpus health can never
  trigger an embedding spend or change what is stored. The single exception is the
  composition BASELINE: a class-share shift cannot be measured without a prior reading,
  so each read may append one ``{at, rows, shares}`` entry (no case id, no chunk text,
  no rule identity, no secret) to the advisory ``rag_health`` KV document. It is capped
  at eight readings, written only when the reading actually changed and only above the
  row floor on an untruncated read, CAS-routed, and fail-open — a write failure reports
  the shift as unmeasured rather than failing the request.
* **Honest about unknowns.** ``RagService.last_projection`` is in-process only and empty
  until the first projection in that process; that is reported as ``not_yet_projected``,
  never as a zero that looks like a collapse. Every signal that could not be evaluated
  is listed in ``unknowns`` so insufficient evidence stays explicit.
* **Advisory (#3).** Nothing here is read by ``case_manager.decide()``; the auto-close
  policy and the corpus counts are displayed, never fed back.
* **No prompt path (#9).** Corpus source labels are sanitised at write time and are
  returned here as plain JSON the UI renders escaped — exactly as ``GET /api/rag/stats``
  already does. Nothing on this surface ever reaches a model prompt, and no secret,
  case id, document text, or chunk content is returned.
* **Additive + default-safe (#10).** New endpoints only — no new configuration, no new
  scheduled or background work; the one advisory composition write above happens inside
  the request that reads the endpoint and nowhere else.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# CORPUS COMPOSITION — the health signal a size guard cannot give.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The existing projection guard is a SIZE guard: it refuses a rebuild that emptied or
# drastically shrank the corpus. A reprojection that keeps the same chunk count and
# flips the meaning of every one of them passes it cleanly, and that is not a
# hypothetical. On the deployment that motivated this work, the obvious dashboard —
# ANALYST OUTCOME ALONE — read 198 ``false_positive`` / 2 ``true_positive``. That looks
# exactly like a healthy SOC corpus, and it stayed green for the entire incident, while
# the corpus was actively poisoning the model: nearly all of those rows carried no
# independent ground truth at all, so the agent was reading its own prior verdicts back
# as operator evidence and confirming itself.
#
# Outcome alone cannot show that. The CROSS-TAB can:
#
#     (analyst outcome  x  model verdict  x  ground-truth source)
#
# Split those 198 rows by the source of their label and by what the model itself had
# said, and the same corpus reads "196 of 200 rows have ground_truth_source=none and
# agree with the model's own verdict" — a sentence no operator would call healthy.
#
# What this alarms on, and what it deliberately does NOT:
#
# * ROW COUNT — never. Size is the guard that already exists, and a corpus is allowed
#   to be small, to grow and to shrink.
# * DISAGREEMENT LEVEL — never. "The analyst disagreed with the model" is what a
#   working queue produces all day; alarming on it fires permanently on exactly the
#   deployments where analysts do the most work, and goes quiet on the ones where
#   nobody grades anything. It is an inverted signal.
# * CLASS-SHARE SHIFT — yes. Composition MOVING is the observable a poisoning event
#   produces and a healthy corpus does not. It needs a baseline, so readings are kept
#   as a bounded series in the durable health record (``RagHealthStore``); a deployment
#   with no prior reading reports the shift as UNMEASURED rather than as zero.
# * SINGLE-TRANSACTION CONCENTRATION — yes. A cell that is overwhelmingly one bulk
#   action speaks with one voice however many rows it holds, and the bounded precedent
#   window then evicts everything else. Reported with the evidence NAMED (the share of
#   the cell held by one rule identity, and the share carrying a bulk-ratification
#   marker), because those are proxies for "one transaction" rather than a transaction
#   id the corpus does not store.
#
# Advisory only (#3): nothing here is read by ``decide()``, by scoring, or by the
# projection. Read-only over corpus METADATA — no chunk text, no case id and no analyst
# identity leaves this block. The dominating RULE IDENTITY is named plainly, exactly as
# the sibling ``precedent_effectiveness.distribution`` block on this same
# ``settings:read`` response already does, because the operator cannot act on "one
# contributor holds this class" without knowing which one. Nothing here is persisted
# with an identity attached: ``observe_composition`` stores only ``{at, rows, shares}``.
# Nothing on this surface reaches a prompt (#9); it is plain JSON the Console escapes.

    Vectors from two embedding models are not comparable, so a document embedded by the

    re-embeds the bounded precedent window leaves everything outside that window exactly
    there, and every count on this surface (corpus size, per-source chunks, the
    reconciliation) keeps reporting those documents as present, because they are.

    metadata alone we cannot tell the supported keyless profile (fully reachable) from

    """WHAT the precedent corpus is made of — now, and after a rebuild. Read-only.

    **Reprojection is not the repair, and this endpoint is what proves it.** The
    projection pages the case store newest-first, so on the deployment that motivated
    this the bulk-confirmed cases were still the newest analyst-confirmed terminal cases:
    a rebuild RE-SELECTS them and converges on the composition it just replaced. Worse,
    the qualifying POOL was MORE skewed than the window drawn from it, so no selection
    policy over that pool could have produced a healthy corpus. A successful rebuild is
    therefore not evidence of repair, and "the job succeeded" must never be read as one.

    What makes that visible, and what the payload carries:

    * the JOINT (analyst outcome x model verdict) cross-tab, for the CURRENT corpus and
      for the projection a rebuild WOULD produce. Per-outcome counts alone read PRISTINE
      through the entire incident — a corpus that is 100% ``outcome=false_positive`` and
      also 100% ``verdict=NEEDS_HUMAN`` is telling the investigator "we escalated this
      every time", not "this is benign";
    * per-rule counts, and chunk/document totals;
    * the size of the qualifying POOL the bounded window was drawn from, so "200 of 889"
      is legible rather than implied;
    * the admission CONCENTRATION — how much of the selected window one operator
      transaction bought.

    It is deliberately a SEPARATE endpoint rather than a block inside
    ``/api/diagnostics/health``: deriving the would-be projection costs a bounded scan of
    the case store, and the health rollup is polled by the Console. It costs **zero
    embedding calls** either way — both halves come from a management read plus the
    ordinary per-case projector, whose metadata already carries both axes.

    Gated on ``settings:read`` like the rest of this router, seed-free, and advisory (#3).
