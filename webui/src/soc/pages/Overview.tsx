/**
 * Overview — the Cyber Defence Center (default landing surface).
 *
 * A dense command-center dashboard adapted from the operator-provided Stitch concept:
 *
 *   ┌ MASTHEAD ─── a PLAIN, dense <PageHeader> (no card / no glow — the big title sits
 *   │             flush on the page background, like the Sources page) carrying the
 *   │             <TimeRangePicker> + auto-refresh + a manual refresh pulse in its `meta`
 *   │             slot, i.e. BESIDE the title on the left. The right half is deliberately
 *   │             empty: the page's search lives in the app shell's top bar, one band up.
 *   ├ KPI STRIP ── five borderless, SERVER-FED telemetry cells separated by hairlines:
 *   │             Total Cases · Total Critical · Open Cases · False Positive Rate ·
 *   │             Resolved / Closed, at `density="compact"` because the strip HEADS this
 *   │             page rather than being all of it. Four are cohort numbers scoped to the
 *   │             selected window; "Open Cases" is a window-EXEMPT stock and says so, so
 *   │             it is never read as a fifth summand. Each cell DISCLOSES its own
 *   │             drill-down panel below the strip (see "Drill-down" further down).
 *   ├ LATTICE ──── ONE twelve-column `xl` band, three rows (see the block comment on it):
 *   │               row 1  Noise-Reduction flow (8)      · Human-vs-AI attribution (4)
 *   │               row 2  open + resolved snapshots (8) · latest-case queue (4)
 *   │               row 3  MTTD / response                        (full width)
 *   │             The flow leads because it is the page's widest instrument and its own
 *   │             container query needs 608px of cell width to draw a graph at all.
 *   └ DEEPER ───── a COLLAPSED "Deeper analytics" group folding the secondary bands
 *                  (spend tripwire, full response timing, autonomy split, connectors,
 *                  case-volume, workload, top signatures/entities).
 *
 * Opening a case from the latest-case queue or from a drill-down row does NOT navigate:
 * it mounts the shared <CaseDetail> in its right-hand sheet over this page, so the
 * numerals stay on screen behind it. The mount is conditional (see the bottom of the
 * render) because CaseDetail reads auth context unconditionally.
 *
 * Data: `usePosture(hours, 'prev')` is the AUTHORITATIVE server-side lifecycle rollup
 * (MTTA/MTTR/dwell/MTTD p50 + SLA + quality rates + period-over-period deltas). It is
 * STALE-WHILE-REVALIDATE: a window change keeps the last successful snapshot mounted
 * (marked by the tiles' "Loading Nh" sub) instead of blanking every posture consumer.
 * `listCases` (current + previous window), `getMetrics` (timing_trend + by_status),
 * `usageSummary`, `noiseReduction`, and `metricsTrends` (the hover-trend
 * bucket series) are fetched with allSettled so one failing call degrades a single
 * widget, never the page; a superseded window's late-settling batch is discarded.
 * Usage and Noise Reduction keep independent availability/error state: a failed refresh
 * retains the last usable value, names the unavailable slice, and offers a slice-only
 * Retry. `noiseReduction`/`sourcesCoverage`/`metricsTrends` are typeof-guarded so a
 * minimal test/mock surface can still omit the optional contracts.
 *
 * Drill-down: every strip tile is a WAI DISCLOSURE trigger. Activating one opens a
 * docked, non-modal `<section>` under the strip — a sibling of the grid, never a sixth
 * child of it — carrying that tile's own population with filtering, sorting and its own
 * time range, so the detail is read ALONGSIDE the five numerals instead of replacing
 * them. The full-list deep link survives as the panel's drill-through, and the panel is
 * where a touch device now reaches the tile's trend, since the hover card is force-closed
 * for as long as the panel is up. One panel at a time; Escape closes it and returns focus
 * to the tile.
 *
 * Hover trendlines: every landing metric with an HONEST server series reveals it on
 * hover/focus via `MetricHoverTrend` (metrics/trends buckets, `timing_trend`, or the
 * usage `cost_over_time` ledger series). A metric with no genuine series — the Critical
 * tile (no per-severity bucket series) and the Open Cases stock (no open-count-over-time
 * series) — deliberately carries no affordance at all rather than an invented
 * decorative trend, and the strip carries no in-tile sparklines: every numeral on it
 * comes from the posture rollup, so a spark derived from the bounded case page would
 * chart a different population than the number above it.
 *
 * Scale context: every KPI numeral is paired with the denominator it is a share of,
 * and each pair comes from ONE payload so numerator and denominator always describe
 * the same population. A share whose evidence is incomplete, whose denominator is
 * missing, or whose denominator does not describe this window renders an em dash with
 * the reason NAMED in the tile's sub — never a synthetic 0%, and never a rounded-down
 * 0% beside a non-zero numeral ("<1%"). Two tiles are share-less by construction:
 * Total Cases IS the cohort denominator, and Open Cases is a window-exempt stock that
 * no window population reconciles with.
 *
 * Coverage: the posture-fed tiles gate on `#103`'s `window_covered`, NOT on
 * `truncated`. Truncation is permanent above the route's fetch bound, so the old gate
 * withheld every share forever on any sizeable deployment; coverage is the narrower,
 * checkable claim that every row which could satisfy the SELECTED window was read.
 * `postureCovered` is computed once for the whole page, so the strip, the Human-vs-AI
 * card and the Noise-Reduction funnel cannot gate the same evidence three ways. An
 * uncovered window keeps its COUNTS (a floor is still a number an operator can act on)
 * and withholds only the shares, naming the bound in each tile's sub.
 *
 * Security (#9): every label/value here is a humanized enum, a formatted number, or
 * backend-derived text rendered as PLAIN text. No untrusted string is injected as markup.
 *
 * Advisory (#3): NOTHING on this dashboard feeds `decide()` — it reads the outcome of
 * triage; it never influences close/escalate.

               ONE band, three rows, all on the SAME twelve-column xl grid:

                 row 1  noise-reduction flow (8)          · close attribution (4)
                 row 2  open + resolved snapshots (8)     · latest-case queue (4)
                 row 3  MTTD / response                            (full width)

               This used to be two sibling bands — an INSTRUMENT grid at `lg:` and an
               OPERATIONS grid at `xl:` — which cost a duplicated `border-y` pair and a
               16px gap between two things that read as one instrument panel.

               ⚠️ THE GRID IS `xl:`, NEVER `lg:`. The flow diagram's own container query
               hides its graph below 38rem (608px) of CONTAINER width and silently falls
               back to a text rail. The tightest supported desktop is a 1280px viewport
               with the sidebar pinned (its default), and the margin there is thin enough
               that the arithmetic has to be exact:

                 layout width   = 1280 − S (the ROOT SCROLLBAR: media queries still match
                                  at 1280 while the scrollbar has already taken its width
                                  out of layout. theme.css pins it — `scrollbar-width:
                                  thin` plus a 10px `::-webkit-scrollbar` — so S ≈ 10,
                                  but it is NOT zero, which is what an earlier version of
                                  this comment assumed)
                 − 240 (sidebar, in flow) − 64 (content inset at lg:px-8) = 966
                 × 8/12 = 644, − 24 (px-3) − 1 (border) = 619px.

               That clears 608 by ~11px, and still clears it (~614px) even on a UA that
               ignores both scrollbar rules and draws a classic 17px bar. The horizontal
               padding is `px-3` rather than `p-4` for exactly this reason — the 8px it
               returns is most of the safety margin — and it also puts all three rows of
               this band on ONE 12px left rail, matching the 4-column cells beside them.

               On an `lg:` grid the same cell at a 1024px viewport would be ~448px and the
               graph would silently vanish on every laptop. Below `xl` the rows stack
               full-width, which is far wider still. Four columns can never carry the flow:
               even at the 1920px cap that is 608px BEFORE padding. Hence 8/4, not 6/6.

          component the Scans and Investigate boards mount — so its RBAC gates, lifecycle
          actions and untrusted-text handling are the ones already reviewed there. A
          second case surface would fork all three.

          Mounted CONDITIONALLY, which is not a style choice: CaseDetail calls `useAuth()`
          unconditionally, ABOVE its own empty-state return, and `useAuth` throws outside
          an <AuthProvider>. This page uses no auth hook of its own and none of its specs
          supplies a provider, so an always-mounted CaseDetail would throw on every render
          of the dashboard under test. The honest cost is the sheet's exit animation: an
          unmount cannot play one. */}
