/**
 * HumanVsAiCard — "Human vs AI": how the selected window's cases were CLOSED.
 *
 * The landing dashboard's close-attribution instrument. It replaced the Active Risk
 * Index in the instrument band because "who actually closed this work?" is the
 * question the autonomy story turns on, and the page already carries risk everywhere
 * else (per-case gauges, the severity donuts, the risk-ordered queue).
 *
 * WHAT IT SHOWS
 *   - Three headline counts + three RECONCILING percentages: agent-closed,
 *     analyst-closed, and the system/unattributed RESIDUAL. The denominator is the
 *     window's CLOSED (terminal) cases, so the three shares sum to exactly 100% and
 *     the residual is visible instead of being folded into either side.
 *   - A two/three-series trendline over the same window's buckets.
 *
 * HONESTY CONTRACT
 *   - `decision_by` is LAST-WRITER, not proof of authorship: an agent-closed case a
 *     human later merely ACKNOWLEDGES or re-tags migrates into the human series. The
 *     card discloses this in its (?) help affordance — it never claims the chart
 *     proves who did the work.
 *   - Operator "declared benign" (analyst rule policy) closes are excluded upstream:
 *     no model ran on them, so they are neither agent nor human triage work.
 *   - The residual band is labelled and always rendered; folding it away would leave
 *     two percentages that silently fail to sum to 100.
 *   - A missing/unreconciling partition renders an em dash per band — NEVER a
 *     reassuring 0% (ui-standard "Evidence-led analytics").
 *   - A STALE partition (the previous window's payload, while the newly selected
 *     window is still in flight) is withheld entirely: `windowLabel` already names the
 *     new window, so printing last window's counts beneath it would be a mislabel.
 *   - A bucket with no measurement is a GAP in the line (MultiSeriesTrend renders
 *     `null` as a gap), never a fabricated zero.
 *   - Alert volume, when shown, is a plainly LABELLED ingest-hour tally. It is a
 *     different population from the case cohort (many alerts collapse into one case
 *     by cluster signature), so it is never divided into a case count.
 *
 * Advisory (#3): purely a read of triage OUTCOMES. Nothing here feeds `decide()`.
 * Security (#9): every label is a local constant and every value a formatted number,
 * rendered as PLAIN text.
