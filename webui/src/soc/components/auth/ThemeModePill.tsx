/**
 * ThemeModePill — the identity canvas's Light mode / Dark mode switch.
 *
 * A gradient pill that names the mode you are currently IN, with a crescent on
 * the left and a plain disc on the right that scale-swap as the mode changes,
 * a label that slides toward whichever glyph is showing, and two blurred orbs
 * behind the pill that trade sides on every toggle. Every effect is a CSS
 * transition in `theme.css` keyed off `data-appearance` — no animation library,
 * and the global reduced-motion rule neutralises all of it for free.
 *
 * Two structural rules keep the measured contrast honest:
 *
 *   - The glyphs live in FIXED side cells of a three-column grid, so the label
 *     can never drift over the bright end of either gradient. Contrast was
 *     measured across the label's cell only (>= 5.1:1 in both states).
 *   - The orbs sit at `z-index: 0` BEHIND an opaque `__track` at `z-index: 1`,
 *     so a glow can never tint the surface the label is measured against.
 *
 * Accessibility: the pill is a plain button, not a `switch` — "Light mode,
 * switch, off" is a worse announcement than a button that says what it does.
 * The accessible name opens with the visible label, so WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in
 * Name) holds for voice control, then states the action. There is no `title`:
 * it would duplicate the accessible name and some screen readers would announce
 * the string twice.
