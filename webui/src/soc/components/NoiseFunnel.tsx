/**
 * NoiseFunnel — the selected-window Noise Reduction instrument in the Security
 * Command Center.
 *
 * Simple draws a full, filled alert-to-case flow. Alerts, clusters, and cases remain
 * different units, so those first two ribbons use a disclosed compressed display scale;
 * exact counts stay in their labels. From opened cases onward, the case-unit ribbons
 * conserve the backend outcome partitions:
 *
 *     alerts → clusters → cases ⇉ auto-cleared | escalated ⇉ human-closed | remainder
 *
 * Simple is the default direct-labelled graph. Detailed intentionally restores the
 * Testing renderer as a separate compatibility presentation: its 640x220 stretched
 * canvas, processing spine, overlapping outcome fan, loss badges, and complete evidence
 * rail remain unchanged. Open cases are shown as separate selected-window lifecycle
 * context because they are not equal to the conserved escalated remainder.
 *
 * Binds VERBATIM to the §D `GET /api/metrics/noise-reduction` contract (the
 * `NoiseReduction` type). When the durable ingest counters are still warming up
 * (`counters.available === false`) it degrades gracefully to a case-only funnel.
 *
 * #9: every value shown is an aggregate count or a fixed stage label (no raw log
 * text), rendered as plain text — UNTRUSTED-safe by construction. Colours resolve
 * from approved theme/semantic tokens only (no raw hex; design gate). The SVG is
 * decorative; graph labels or the Detailed evidence rail carry the accessible values.
 * Refresh feedback is one-shot, data-keyed, and absent under reduced motion.

            Labels are the exact counts and units, and each percentage is that stage&apos;s
            share of the stage it came from — clusters of alerts ingested, cases of clusters,
            the case split of cases opened, and human closure of escalated cases. The first
            stage is the baseline, so it shows an em dash.
