            (the trigger's top padding is 8px; the overlay spans y 8→32). But the row is
            `items-end`, so the only child that ever reaches the overlay's x-range — the
            scale context, with its `mb-0.5` — sits at y 36→50: 4px BELOW the overlay, at
            every strip width. A `pr-10` here therefore bought nothing, and cost the context
            40px — enough to ellipsize "54 of 80 verdicted" at 1440px, recoverable only by
            mouse-hovering the `title`, which is no recovery at all for touch or keyboard.

            The one child that WOULD collide is a `delta` chip: its border box runs y 22→46
            and, unlike text, it is visibly bordered. No `density="compact"` caller passes
            one today. Re-measure before adding the first. */}
