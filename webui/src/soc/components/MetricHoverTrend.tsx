/**
 * MetricHoverTrend — the ONE hover/focus trendline affordance for a dashboard metric.
 *
 * Wraps any metric presentation (a KPI tile, a timing stat, a snapshot total) in a
 * Radix HoverCard whose content is the metric's honest recent trend: the metric name,
 * a compact axis-less sparkline, the measured window disclosure ("last 24 hours ·
 * 1h buckets"), and the first/latest measured values as plain text. Composes the
 * existing `ui/hover-card` primitives + the LAZY `Sparkline` from `charts.tsx`
 * (recharts stays off the static import graph exactly like `KpiTile`'s spark).
 *
 * Honesty rules:
 *   - `points` preserve nulls as NOT-MEASURED buckets. They are never drawn as zeros;
 *     the sparkline renders measured points only and, when some buckets are missing,
 *     the card discloses "N of M buckets measured".
 *   - Fewer than two measured points → the trend content is OMITTED and a quiet
 *     "No trend data yet." line renders instead (never a decorative invented trend).
 *   - Every value is a formatted number / fixed label rendered as plain text (#9).
 *
 * Accessibility (WCAG 1.4.13): the trigger participates in the tab order (either the
 * child is itself focusable — pass `focusable={false}` — or the wrapper takes
 * `tabIndex=0`, mirroring `CaseHoverCard`), Radix opens the card on focus as well as
 * hover (focus events bubble, so a focusable CHILD reaching focus opens it too), the
 * content itself is hoverable, and the sparkline carries a text summary via its
 * `role="img"` label. Colors come from the token palette only.
 *
 * Touch access: hover cannot open the card on touch-only devices (Radix ignores
 * touch pointers and suppresses trigger focus), so `toggleOnClick` (default: the
 * `focusable` value) makes a press on the wrapper toggle the card. Wrappers whose
 * CHILD is itself clickable keep the default OFF so navigation presses never fight
 * the card; Escape and press-outside dismissal keep working via Radix. A press landing
 * on an interactive descendant is ALWAYS ignored, so a wrapper around a clickable child
 * has no touch path to the card at all — which is why the card's content is exported as
 * `MetricTrendBody` for the surface that press opens to restate.
 *
 * Coexisting with a modal panel: `forceClosed` holds the card shut and refuses every
 * open transition. A disclosure opened FROM the wrapped child needs it — the card opens
 * on focus (so the panel's focus return would otherwise pop it straight back), it renders
 * over the panel, and its dismissable layer would swallow the panel's Escape.
 *
 * That suppression deliberately OUTLASTS the transition. Radix opens on a timer: focus
 * arms a `setTimeout(openDelay)` and the resulting `onOpenChange(true)` lands whenever it
 * lands — by which time a prop read at callback time says `forceClosed` is already false.
 * A purely synchronous guard therefore let the focus return that ACCOMPANIES a dismissal
 * re-open the card ~`openDelay` later, so an explicit Escape was answered by a new overlay
 * and needed a second Escape. When `forceClosed` falls, opens stay refused for a further
 * `openDelay` grace period, which is exactly long enough to swallow the transition's own
 * in-flight timer without blocking a fresh, deliberate hover or press.
