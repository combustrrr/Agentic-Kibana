# Agentic SOC

Agentic SOC is a self-hosted, vendor-agnostic security operations platform that
turns high-volume alerts into explainable, audited, human-reviewable cases.

It connects to existing security data, normalises records to OCSF, correlates and
risk-scores them deterministically, uses role-separated AI investigation, and applies
operator policy through a deterministic case manager. The model can recommend a
verdict; it cannot decide to close or escalate a case.

Treat `v0.1.13` as installable only when its GitHub Release contains the canonical
signed plan, all three referenced GHCR image digests are anonymously pullable, and
the canonical PostgreSQL Compose bootstrap/update acceptance completes.
The immutable `v0.1.4` and `v0.1.5` tags record failed, non-installable publication
attempts. The immutable `v0.1.6` tag records a fully published and signed artifact
set whose canonical macOS Bash 3.2 bootstrap acceptance failed before supervisor
installation. The immutable `v0.1.7` tag also has a complete signed/public artifact
set, but canonical Docker Desktop acceptance found that its dropped-capability
updater could not publish the private control socket. The immutable `v0.1.8`
publication corrected that boundary, then canonical bootstrap failed when cosign 3
tried to initialize its default TUF cache beneath the updater's read-only `/root`.
The immutable `v0.1.9` publication then built, signed, and anonymously proved all
three images, but its constrained supervisor could not traverse the runner-owned
verification directory, so it never published a GitHub Release or installable plan.
The immutable `v0.1.10` tag passed source and exact-tag CI, but its release job
timed out while target emulation ran the architecture-neutral Web Console builder;
it published no GitHub Release or installable signed plan. The immutable `v0.1.11`
workflow then built, signed, anonymously proved, and verified all three images and
the canonical plan on the host and inside the constrained updater, but its
post-verification cleanup trap failed before attestations, GitHub Release, canonical
asset, Stable-tag, or Stable-documentation publication. The immutable `v0.1.12`
release then published the complete signed plan, public images, attestations, GitHub
Release, Stable tags, and Stable documentation; canonical v0.1.1 acceptance exposed
an asymmetric missing-schema-label comparison in its supervisor and stopped before
application mutation. All nine are historical and
must not be used as deployment, bootstrap, or update sources; never move or reuse
their tags. Version 0.1.13 retains the writable
updater-state trust cache and materializes read-only verification assets with explicit
traversal permissions, while running the documentation and Node builder stages on
BuildKit's native platform and keeping the final runtime multi-platform. Its
release-only cleanup restores the runner-owned fixture directory to mode `0700`
after constrained verification, then removes it. It also treats matching absent
legacy state-schema labels as one coherent unknown identity while rejecting a mixed
pair and every unmanaged later release. It makes no
schema, protocol, identity, privilege, or frozen-base change.

## What Agentic SOC delivers

- **One case workflow:** ingest, cluster, investigate, collaborate, decide, and audit
  without moving between disconnected tools.
- **Vendor-agnostic sources:** pull from Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, and Wazuh; receive
  supported HTTP, syslog, queue, and object-store events through connector interfaces.
- **OCSF-normalised evidence:** source records enter one canonical schema before
  correlation or model use.
- **Explainable investigation:** the Case Manager keeps source facts, agent findings,
  risk factors, provenance, timeline, threat context, collaboration, and chat together.
- **Deterministic control:** code—not a model, prompt, runbook, or playbook—owns the
  final close/escalate decision.
- **Measured AI spend:** every model call crosses one gateway and produces a usage and
  cost record. Fresh workspaces use OpenAI GPT-5.6 Luna for completion roles; models
  and providers remain configurable.
- **Operational intelligence:** runbooks, playbooks, enrichment, operator memory,
  knowledge retrieval, MITRE ATT&CK context, campaigns, baselines, and auto-tuning.
- **Built for teams:** RBAC, MFA, SSO, sessions, notifications, case collaboration,
  audit history, saved views, and per-user chat history.
- **Durable long work:** bulk case operations, exports, knowledge maintenance, resets,
  and lifecycle apply continue server-side across navigation/reload, with personal Jobs,
  audit-confirmed Inbox progress, cooperative cancellation, bounded failures, and
  verified artifacts. The Console is Jobs-only; selected direct long-operation APIs
  remain explicitly deprecated compatibility primitives, while direct reset/storage
  mutations are retired.
- **Selectable state:** PostgreSQL with pgvector, Elasticsearch, or SQLite.
- **A complete standalone Console:** responsive light and dark themes, first-run setup,
  live dashboards, Cases, Case Manager, Analytics, Intelligence, Settings, and bundled
  documentation.
- **Window-safe operations:** Overview rejects stale posture responses after a range
  change; full Agent health lives in range-aware Analytics Effectiveness, while Overview
  shows only a positive degradation warning.
- **Supervised Stable updates:** after one bootstrap, the reference PostgreSQL Compose
  deployment can apply a compatible signed, digest-pinned release from the Console with
  verified backup, durable progress, readiness checks, and automatic in-flight rollback.

## Safety model

The core guardrails are architectural contracts, not prompt instructions:

| Contract | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only source access | Pull connectors use narrowly scoped credentials and do not modify the upstream log platform. |
| Deterministic case authority | Only operator-configured code can close or escalate; uncertain cases route to a human. |
| Untrusted-data fencing | Source-controlled and user-influenced values are labelled and fenced before model use. |
| Complete cost accounting | Every model call passes through one gateway and enters the cost ledger. |
| Durable processing | Cursors and cluster signatures prevent silent skips and duplicate cases. |
| Append-only accountability | Agent and operator actions are preserved in the audit history. |
| Secrets stay secret | Secret values remain in the environment or runtime secret tier; the UI receives configured-state booleans only. |
| Graceful degradation | Optional enrichment and external services fail safely without bypassing human review. |

[deterministic-decision contract](docs/concepts/deterministic-decisions.md) before

Agentic SOC Console and API
```

The FastAPI backend owns connectors, OCSF conversion, agent orchestration, policy,
authentication, persistence, and the API. The Vite/React Console is the primary and
only supported operator surface. The retired Kibana plugin remains archived and is
not built, tested, or shipped.

See [Architecture](docs/concepts/architecture.md) for the complete request and data
flow.

## Explore locally

The deterministic demo is the fastest way to see the full workflow. It generates
isolated multi-source security stories and forces a `$0` mock model, even if provider
keys exist.

Requirements: Python 3.11, Node.js 22, npm, and Bash on macOS or Linux.

```bash
./scripts/run-demo.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. The standard demo account is
`Admin` / `Admin@123`. Stop both processes with `Ctrl+C`.

Demo credentials are for loopback evaluation only. Never expose or reuse them with
real data. Continue with the [Demo guide](docs/getting-started/demo.md) and
[first-case walkthrough](docs/getting-started/first-case.md).

## Run the standalone evaluation stack

The recommended Compose stack runs PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, the backend, the
nginx-served Console, and the private update supervisor. Connected security systems
remain separate.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Configure unique database, authentication, and provider secrets in .env.

./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh config --quiet
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh up --detach --build
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh ps
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>, complete first-run setup, and verify the service:

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/api/health/live
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/api/health/ready
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/api/health/build-info
```

Stop the stack without deleting its named state volume:

```bash
./scripts/agentic-soc-compose.sh down
```

The wrapper is the canonical lifecycle entry point. After the one-time updater
bootstrap it automatically preserves the supervisor-selected, digest-pinned release
override; raw Compose commands can bypass that override and are unsupported. See the
[upgrade contract](docs/operations/upgrades.md).

Use the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/install.md) for prerequisites and
the [deployment guide](DEPLOY.md) for TLS, secrets, backups, authentication, source
credentials, and production hardening.

## Configure real data

1. Begin with one narrow, least-privilege source credential.
2. Map and inspect a representative non-sensitive record.
3. Confirm source identity, timestamp, rule, severity, entities, and provenance.
4. Verify the resulting case, model cost, and audit history.
5. Widen the source scope only after the complete path is correct.

Configuration has two layers:

- **Environment secrets:** copy [`.env.example`](.env.example); never commit the
  resulting `.env` file.
- **Operator preferences:** use the first-run wizard and **Settings** for sources,
  models, policy, automation, enrichment, notifications, identity, retention, and
  release discovery.

## Develop and verify

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing
the system. Keep deterministic case authority, API compatibility, auditability,
accessibility, and the Journal workflow intact.

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

Console:

```bash
cd webui
npm ci
npm run test:strict
npm run check:types
npm run lint
npm run gates
npm run build
```

Tests use fake stores and mock models where appropriate; backend tests must remain
offline. The Console build type-checks the application and bundles documentation that
matches the application version.
