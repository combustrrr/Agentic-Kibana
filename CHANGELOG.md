# Changelog

All notable changes to **Agentic SOC** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This is a **vendor-agnostic** suite — no single log source is "the" target. Elastic /
Elasticsearch **8.19.12** is the compatibility target only when *optionally* attaching
to a legacy ELK stack as a read-only consumer (the archived Kibana plugin additionally
targeted **8.12.2**; it is now frozen and no longer version-stamped going forward).
History is reconstructed from `git log`.

## [Unreleased]

**The self-running deployment that stopped closing cases.** A field report from a
long-running autonomous instance traced a fall from roughly 96% auto-close to zero,
with no operator-visible signal anywhere in the product. The cause was not one bug but
a chain: the resolved-case precedent corpus eroded and was then wiped outright, the
threshold tuner recorded changes the pipeline structurally discarded, proposal approval
could report failure while its effect was already live, and on PostgreSQL every
privileged audit write was impossible. Each failure was silent, and the only trace of
the corpus loss was an ordinary-looking `RAG seeded with 20 chunk(s)` at INFO — a line
that reads identically whether the number is 2000 or 0. This release fixes the chain
and, just as importantly, makes each of these conditions a state an operator can see.

### Fixed

- **The MFA enrollment QR code is now actually scannable.** The hand-rolled QR encoder
  carried three ISO/IEC 18004 conformance defects: it never placed the two
  version-information blocks required from symbol version 7 upward (every real
  `otpauth://` provisioning URI is version 7+, so data bits landed in the modules a
  scanner reads the version from), the first format-information copy was transposed
  against the spec placement order, and the Reed-Solomon remainder loop applied the
  generator polynomial one position late — so the error-correction bytes were not a
  valid codeword at *any* version and every scan relied on reader error tolerance.
  All three are fixed; the rewritten test suite includes an independent structural
  decoder (format/version BCH checks, function-map rebuild, un-masking, zigzag walk,
  block de-interleave, zero-syndrome verification, byte-mode round-trip at v3/v7/v10)
  that fails on each defect individually when reverted.
- **Changing the dashboard time range no longer stalls the headline numbers or blanks
  the page.** Five endpoints behind the Overview (posture, noise-reduction,
  auto-close-health, diagnostics health, sources coverage) each independently fetched
  and re-validated a 5,000-document case page on every refresh — multiplied by the 5s
  LIVE poll. A shared single-flight case-page cache (5s TTL, keyed by fetch limit,
  guarded by store identity so Demo Mode's store swap self-invalidates) collapses the
  fan-out to one scan per window; the sources-coverage count is pushed down to the
  store (`count_created_since`: an ES `_count`, a SQL `COUNT`, a format-robust base
  fallback) and fetches zero documents; the posture computation builds its per-case
  timing index once (byte-identical outputs, ~31% faster at 5k cases). On the Console,
  a window change now keeps the last snapshot visible with an explicit stale indicator
  instead of flashing empty tiles, and a supersession guard stops a superseded
  window's late responses from repainting newer data.
- **A role-level MFA enforcement can no longer dead-end the env-seeded admin.**
  `requires_mfa()` now refuses to mandate an env-managed account (it has no persisted
  user record and could never complete enrollment) — previously
  `mfa.enforce_for_roles` covering the seeded admin's role produced an unanswerable
  challenge.
- **The role editor grid no longer hides three resources.** The client's
  permission-vocabulary mirror was missing `runbooks`, `system_updates`, and `rules`
  relative to the backend policy, so those rows were silently absent from the custom
  role matrix editor.

- **A provider outage can no longer silently empty the knowledge corpus, and the
  product can no longer report itself healthy while it happens.** A field report
  described a deployment that lost its LLM/embedding API key: every call returned HTTP
  401. The suite degraded exactly as designed — embeddings fell back to local hashing,
  each case failed to a human, no wrong verdict was produced — and then destroyed its
  own knowledge corpus without a single alarm. Chunks written during the outage carried
  hash-space vectors that are meaningless in the real embedding space and carried no
  marker distinguishing them; the next reprojection invalidated that space, re-seeded,
  and left the corpus at **zero rows**. Because `ensure_seeded()` is lazy and
  signature-cached, it considered itself finished and never rebuilt. For **three days**
  every case retrieved 0 knowledge and 0 precedents and returned `NEEDS_HUMAN` at
  0.96–0.98 confidence, auto-close sat at **0%** — and `GET /api/health` returned
  `status: ok` with the Console showing **Healthy** throughout. The source of truth was
  never lost: 892 analyst-confirmed cases were still in the database, and one forced
  re-seed restored the corpus and resumed `FALSE_POSITIVE` verdicts immediately. This
  was the second corpus loss of the same shape; the first also left
  `RAG seeded with N chunk(s)` at INFO as its only trace.

  - **A degraded embedding space can never become a durable write.** The gateway now
    classifies each provider failure into a closed vocabulary
    (`unauthenticated` / `quota` / `unsupported` / `unavailable` / `not_configured`) and
    carries it on `EmbeddingBatch.fallback_reason`. RAG refuses to build a chunk from
    any fallback batch except `not_configured` — the supported keyless/offline profile,
    where local hashing is the intended, self-consistent space. Degrading a *read* is
    still correct; degrading a *write* is corruption. Every chunk is additionally
    stamped with `embedding_fallback_reason`, so a mixed-space corpus is detectable
    rather than silently wrong, and an all-zero vector is now rejected before a partial
    write (a contract the documentation already promised).
  - **A projection can no longer reach zero.** A rebuild that yields no chunks while the
    previous corpus held some, or that falls below the new
    `rag.min_projection_retention` floor (default 0.5), is refused as a failed build:
    the previous corpus is kept, the seed does not latch, and the condition is logged at
    **ERROR** with a structured, durable record — not the INFO line that reads the same
    whether the count is 2,000 or 0. The refusal record survives restart in a
    `rag_health` KV document (no new index, table, or migration).
  - **An empty corpus is a first-class health failure.** `GET /api/health` gained
    additive `degraded` / `degraded_reasons` fields carrying opaque, count-free codes
    (the endpoint is anonymous, so corpus detail stays on the `settings:read`-gated
    `/api/diagnostics/health`), and the Console's health pill now shows **Degraded**
    with a specific explanation instead of green "Healthy". Diagnostics gained the
    reconciliation check the incident asked for — *"the corpus holds N documents but the
    case history qualifies M records"* — measured against the bounded precedent window
    so a normal `N < M` never alarms, and reported as an explicit unknown whenever a
    truncated or lower-bound read means the answer cannot be trusted.
  - **A provider outage is now a visible system state.** Consecutive authentication or
    quota failures are tracked per provider and surface as
    `llm_provider: unauthenticated` (distinct from quota and transport failures), and a
    case that reached the investigation time cap *because* the provider is rejecting our
    credentials now says so instead of reporting the time cap. The operator in the field
    report chased latency and evidence quality for days because of that message.
  - **Recovery is automatic or one action.** The seed signature now includes the
    embedding-space identity, a retrieval that finds an empty corpus behind a satisfied
    seed cache rebuilds once on its own, and a new `rag_rebuild` background Job provides
    an explicit, idempotent, documented rebuild. A tiered reset now also invalidates the
    seed cache, closing a path where a reset deployment could stay corpus-less forever.

  Non-negotiable #3 is untouched: `decide()` is byte-identical, the verdict on a failed
  run stays `NEEDS_HUMAN`, and nothing added here is read by the close/escalate decision.
  Ledger behaviour (#6) is unchanged — the same number of usage rows per call.

- **Analyst-confirmed precedent no longer arrives without rule identity, and a
  precedent-rich rule can no longer be silently ignored.** A field report described an
  operator reviewing 349 cases of one detection rule, confirming every one benign through
  the supported `confirm_fp` path, and watching the precedent corpus grow 15 → 314 — while
  the very next case of that rule still returned `NEEDS_HUMAN` at 0.98 confidence.
  Retrieval was working: six analyst-confirmed benign precedents for the identical rule
  were retrieved, one at a perfect score. The investigator was making an
  **evidence-sufficiency** judgement ("these alerts carry no HTTP or execution context"),
  which precedent volume can never move — so confirming 349 cases, or 3,490, would have
  produced the same result. The precedent projection now records rule identity as
  matchable metadata (`rule_identity` / `rule_ids`, on both trust tiers), existing corpora
  are re-tagged in place from the case store on the next projection with no re-embedding,
  and the new per-rule signal below can act on it.
- **A bulk analyst action on one rule can no longer starve every other rule's precedent.**
  The bounded precedent window was filled newest-first across all rules, so 229
  confirmations newer than every other labelled case would have taken all 200 slots and
  dropped every other rule — including one carrying most of the deployment's auto-close
  volume — to zero. That is the precedent-starvation outage in a new form, triggered by an
  operator doing exactly what the product asked of them. The window is now allocated
  round-robin across rule identities (`precedent.window.stratify_by_rule`, ON), so every
  active rule keeps a floor inside the same bounded window.
- **An analyst rule policy can no longer override a person.** The guard asked "did a
  model run?" (`verdict is not None`), but the analyst lifecycle path stamps
  `decision_by=ANALYST` *without* assigning a verdict, and `OPEN_CASE_STATUSES` includes
  escalated / on_hold / investigating / needs_human — so an analyst who **reopened** a
  policy-closed case had it re-closed by the next matching alert, and an escalated
  candidate was flipped back to closed. Their only per-case escape was a loop they could
  not win. A case an analyst has acted on, like one the agent has already investigated, is
  now left entirely alone.
- **`force` always defeats a declaration.** The policy check ran before the force/stability
  branch and took no `force` parameter, so `POST /api/cases/{id}/reinvestigate` returned a
  fresh policy-closed case every time. An analyst tier holds `cases:reinvestigate` but only
  `rules:read`, so they could neither investigate a declared-benign case they suspected was
  a real attack nor revoke the declaration. An explicit per-case human request now always
  wins.
- **The policy-close marker is no longer erasable.** `is_policy_closed()` keyed only on
  `decision_by`, which every analyst action overwrites — and `_guard_transition` permits a
  same-status move, so `confirm_fp` on an already-closed policy case (including in bulk)
  dropped it out of all seven statistical exclusions at once and let the threshold tuner
  count one declaration as N independent analyst labels. The predicate now also reads the
  durable `Case.analyst_policy` payload, which is written only by the policy close and
  cleared by any writer that supersedes it.
- **A partial `PUT /api/rules/analyst-policies/{id}` no longer widens authority.** Every
  optional field defaulted to the widest blast radius and was written over the stored
  record, so omitting `enabled` re-enabled a revoked declaration, omitting `expires_at`
  cleared the expiry, and omitting `source_id` widened one source to all of them. Fields
  the client did not send are now carried forward (`model_fields_set`).
- **Declaration edits record what actually changed.** The audit row carried only the new
  state, so a widened or re-enabled rule could not be traced back to what it was; it now
  records `field: before -> after` for every field that moved.
- **The precedent prompt block no longer claims diligence the code never performed.** It
  asserted that the operator "reviewed these cases individually" (a bulk confirm classifies
  many at once) and that the rule's alerts "are known to arrive without" request/execution
  context — a factual claim about a detection that nothing in the pipeline measures. It now
  states only what `analyst_confirmed_outcome` proves: each outcome carries an explicit
  human classification.
- **The Elasticsearch scan ceiling is no longer applied to every state backend.** The
  in-memory and SQL stores materialise every row, so a complete PostgreSQL read of a corpus
  past 10k chunks was reported as truncated — and since a truncated read withholds both
  precedent promotion and the futility report, that silently disabled the feature on a
  healthy large deployment.
- **A `VectorStore` corpus-wide read is one pass, not one per document.** Adding
  `list_all_chunks()` removes an O(documents x corpus) fan-out that the per-rule precedent
  distribution and the rule-identity re-tag would otherwise have paid on every read: a
  deployment with 846 precedent documents would have performed 846 full corpus scans to
  answer one diagnostics request. The re-tag also short-circuits once the corpus has
  converged, so the one-time migration is genuinely one-time.
- **`GET /api/triage/*` no longer labels every close "Auto-closed by policy".** The
  decision headline compared `decision_by` against the literal string `"human"`, which no
  `DecisionBy` value has ever equalled, so an analyst's own close was reported as
  automation. It now compares against the real vocabulary.
- **Overview posture values can no longer cross time ranges.** The shared posture
  loader keys state to `window_hours` plus comparison mode, aborts superseded reads,
  validates the response's echoed window, and hides an old snapshot synchronously while
  a new one loads. A slow 24-hour response therefore cannot repaint False Positive Rate
  or Auto-resolved after the operator has selected 7 or 30 days; retained LIVE callbacks
  also read the current range rather than closing over a previous one.
- **Missing historical retrieval instrumentation no longer becomes a measured zero.**
  `Case.knowledge_used` keeps its backward-compatible array shape. The new
  `retrieval_observation_status` (`measured`, `not_measured`, or `unavailable`) is
  authoritative for interpreting that array: `[]` is a measured zero only when the
  observation status is `measured`. The separate `retrieval_history_status` lifetime
  marker remains authoritative for completeness; legacy cases stay `unavailable` even
  after a modern update or re-investigation because their earlier lifetime cannot be
  reconstructed. Latest-run audit provenance separately records retrieval as `measured`,
  `not_attempted`, or `unavailable`, with a machine-readable reason. A fail-soft RAG
  outage, unverified last-known-good corpus, or partial query-group failure may still
  provide bounded context to the investigator, but the run remains unavailable and does
  not manufacture a measured zero or completed Case observation.
- **Privileged audit writes were impossible on PostgreSQL.** `SqlAuditRepository.write_strict`
  maps an event id to a deterministic negative 63-bit surrogate key, but `audit.id` was a
  32-bit column, so every keyed strict write failed out of int32 range. Proposal approve and
  reject both write a decision audit row before finalising, so both returned 503 on every
  attempt and no proposal-decision audit row could ever exist. The offline suite never
  caught it because SQLite's `INTEGER` is already 64-bit. The column and its sequence are
  now 64-bit, existing deployments are migrated in place at boot, and the dialect-level
  contract is pinned in tests that need no database server.
- **Proposal approval applied its effect before auditing the decision.** A failure in a
  later step released the lease and returned "no success was reported" while the tuning
  ledger row, the configuration change, and an approval audit line were all already
  written and the proposal was still pending and re-offered. Approval is now four explicit
  phases — prepare, audit, effect, finalise — so an effect can never precede its own audit
  row. This strengthens non-negotiable #2 rather than trading against it: every step was
  already idempotent, so a retry converges instead of double-applying. The swallowed
  exception is now logged, and the failure message is phase-specific instead of always
  claiming a clean no-op.
- **The resolved-case precedent corpus eroded, then was deleted.** Three defects
  compounded. The precedent window counted raw terminal cases, so the agent's own
  unlabelled auto-closes consumed every slot and the corpus shrank precisely as the agent
  succeeded. The bulk and incremental indexing paths wrote different text for the same
  document id, so whichever ran last silently won. And the incremental path never set a
  per-case document id, which grouped every feedback-indexed precedent under one synthetic
  document that the stale sweep could remove in a single call — that, not the erosion, is
  what destroyed the reported corpus. The window now pages until it holds the requested
  number of qualifying items, both paths share one text builder, precedent carries per-case
  document identity, and `resolved_case` is excluded from the stale sweep because its
  projection is a bounded window (absence means "outside the window", never "withdrawn").
  A projection may no longer silently shrink a still-enabled source.
- **The threshold tuner drafted correlation changes the pipeline discards.** Correlation
  deliberately forces `mode=EVERY, n=1` for any group carrying an alerts-role event, and a
  correlation defined inline on a rule definition takes precedence over the entry a
  `correlation_n` raise writes. In both cases the tuner recorded a change as auto-applied
  and reversible while every poll ignored it, then re-drafted the same rule forever.
  Inertness is now detected from positive evidence only — an explicitly configured
  `mode=EVERY`, an inline rule correlation of any mode, or unanimous case evidence that
  every observed firing used the effective override — and such a rule is surfaced as
  untunable-by-`n` with the structural reason instead of being drafted.

### Added

- **The landing dashboard answers "how much is the agent actually closing?"** The
  Active Risk Index — a number no percentage could honestly qualify — gives up its
  place to a **Human vs AI** card: agent, human, and system close counts with their
  shares, over a windowed two-series trendline. The backend now partitions closed
  cases exactly (`human_closed` and `system_closed` join `auto_closed` in both the
  trend buckets and `quality_metrics`), so the unattributed residual is a visible
  band rather than something quietly folded into "human", and the shares total
  exactly one hundred by largest-remainder. Every band falls back to an em dash with
  a named reason when the partition does not reconcile or the sample is bounded, and
  the card states plainly that attribution is last-recorded-decider — an agent-closed
  case a human later merely acknowledges migrates into the human band.
- **Every landing metric now shows its share beside the number**, through a new
  plain-text secondary slot, each against a denominator drawn from the same
  population as its numerator, and each with an explicit condition under which it
  refuses to state a rate rather than divide by a truncated sample.
- **The noise funnel's Simple view shows percentages again**, one per stage against
  its flow parent, so the dispositions of a stage visibly sum to it. The denominator
  is named in every accessible label, and the same rule now holds in the narrow-width
  rail — the view states one rule and shows one rule at every size.
- **Source log browsing became contract-complete**: `GET /api/sources` reports
  `can_browse` from the same predicate the browse routes gate on, `GET /api/logs`
  accepts an optional `source_id` scope, every per-source entry reports whether it is
  a real backing search or a volatile tail, and both routes share one truncation rule
  so they can no longer disagree about the same rows. Pagination, filters, sort,
  columns, deep links, and export remain deliberately deferred.

- **Admin-mandated MFA, enforced inside the login phase.** A per-user `mfa_required`
  flag (settable at creation or later; distinct from `mfa_enabled`, which means
  *enrolled* — it never mints a secret and is not caught by the
  admin-cannot-enable-MFA guard). A mandated-but-unenrolled user's login returns an
  additive `mfa_enrollment_required` phase-1 response with a short-lived pending
  token; two pending-token-gated endpoints (`POST /api/auth/mfa/enroll-setup`,
  `/enroll-confirm`) let the user complete authenticator enrollment during sign-in and
  land in a full session — there is no way past the screen without enrolling. Pending
  tokens stay rejected on every other surface, an already-enrolled account cannot
  replace its factor through this path, and every step is audited.
- **User accounts carry contact identity, and creation shows what a role grants.**
  Create/edit now accept full name, email, and mobile number (rendered as plain text
  everywhere), plus the Require-MFA switch; the users table shows MFA status
  (On / Required / —) and a name-and-email line. The create dialog displays a live
  per-resource permission summary for the selected role (wildcards exploded against
  the shared vocabulary; unknown server resources rendered honestly), lets existing
  custom roles be attached at creation (validated exactly like post-hoc assignment),
  and offers inline fine-graining: an "Adjust permissions…" flow opens the existing
  role matrix editor seeded to inherit the chosen base role, behind the standard
  fresh-auth step-up.
- **19 new enrichment providers (38 registered) with built-in setup guides.** Keyless
  and default-on: CIRCL hashlookup, SANS ISC DShield, Tor Onionoo. Keyless but
  default-off (resolver/latency caveats): Spamhaus ZEN/DBL, Team Cymru MHR, Robtex,
  crt.sh. Keyed, default-off: CrowdSec CTI, Google Safe Browsing, IPQualityScore,
  ipdata, APIVoid, Maltiverse, SecurityTrails, Criminal IP, Netlas, Hybrid Analysis,
  MetaDefender, EmailRep. Every provider manifest (existing ones included) now carries
  `setup_steps` — concrete operator steps naming the exact env var — and an `example`
  of how the source helps triage, rendered on the provider cards as a collapsible
  "How to set up" guide. Score discipline holds: verdict feeds 80-90, graded
  reputations map directly, context feeds cap at 40 and never set `malicious`, so no
  context source alone can cross the fusion cut.
- **Hover trendlines on every landing-dashboard metric with an honest series.** A new
  `GET /api/metrics/trends` (metrics:view) serves zero-filled, UTC-aligned cohort
  buckets that reconcile with the quality metrics — `fp_rate` distinguishes a real
  zero from not-measured, alert volume comes from the durable noise counters — and a
  reusable hover/focus affordance (WCAG 1.4.13 keyboard-reachable) reveals the
  trendline, window, and bucket disclosure for 11 landing metrics. Metrics with no
  honest series (Critical/High split, Active Risk Index, Dwell) deliberately show
  none rather than an invented one.

- **A Console home for both new controls.** `analyst_rule_policies` is an array-of-model
  and `precedent.promotion` a nested object, and the generic Advanced settings form can
  only DESCRIBE structured fields ("edit in its dedicated section") — a section that did
  not exist, so both were reachable only through the raw API. **Settings → Case policy →
  Declared benign** now lists, edits, scopes, bounds, expires and revokes declarations
  behind a confirm dialog, stating in the operator's own words that a declaration closes
  matching alerts with no model call and no human. **Settings → Knowledge & threat context
  → Analyst-confirmed precedent promotion** carries the promotion opt-in and its
  thresholds. For a feature that closes cases without a human, being able to see and
  revoke it is not cosmetic.
- **An optional per-declaration risk ceiling.** `decide()` bounds FALSE_POSITIVE
  auto-close with `max_risk_score`; a declaration had no equivalent and closed at any
  computed risk. An operator can now say "benign here, but investigate an unusually
  high-scoring instance".
- **Analyst rule policies — an operator can state a rule-level fact and have it honoured
  deterministically.** For a detection whose alerts carry no per-case evidence, no amount
  of confirmation can help: the investigation cannot verify that *this* instance is
  benign, so it correctly routes to a human every time. `Preferences.analyst_rule_policies`
  is the exit — an explicit, audited, revocable declaration that a detection is benign in
  this estate. A matching cluster is CLOSED with `disposition=false_positive` and the new
  `DecisionBy.ANALYST_POLICY`, **with no LLM call at all**. Managed through
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/rules/analyst-policies[/{id}]` and
  `POST /api/rules/analyst-policies/{id}/enabled` under the unified `rules:read` /
  `rules:manage` grant. Unlike `suppression_rules` (a field==value event DROP) the case
  stays visible, audited and reopenable, so the volume remains countable. Every rule on a
  cluster must be declared before it closes, so a cluster that also fired an undeclared
  detection is still investigated. `decide()` is untouched (#3): the declaration is
  evaluated before any verdict exists, and it is excluded from every agent-performance
  statistic — false-positive rate, automation rate, auto-close health, the Noise-Reduction
  funnel, case lineage, tuner observed volume and agent-improvement evidence — so it can
  never flatter the agent. It is deliberately invisible to `analyst_confirmed_outcome`, so
  the automation can never train on its own output.
- **Analyst-confirmed precedent promotion (`precedent.promotion`, opt-in, OFF by
  default).** When the rule identity under investigation carries a unanimous, sufficiently
  large body of analyst-confirmed benign outcomes, the investigator is now told so
  explicitly and in **structured** form — a code-computed count in its own TRUSTED prompt
  block — rather than being left to infer it from a handful of retrieved prose snippets.
  This is *evidence promotion*, not a close authority: the verdict still comes from the
  model and `decide()` still applies the operator's auto-close policy. Gates: promotion
  enabled, rule identity matches exactly (a perfect-similarity hit from a **different**
  rule never qualifies), the rule's analyst history is unanimous (`max_conflicting`,
  default 0), at least `min_confirmed` confirmed benign outcomes exist, and at least one
  matching precedent was actually retrieved for this case above `min_similarity`. The
  agent's own lower-trust `model_unconfirmed` tier can never be promoted. The result is
  recorded on the case as `precedent_signal` — with an explicit status when it did *not*
  qualify — and surfaced on the Deterministic decision card, so a close that leaned on
  institutional history is auditable and reversible.
- **The product now says when more confirmations cannot help.** `GET
  /api/diagnostics/health` gains `precedent_effectiveness`: the per-rule precedent
  distribution (so starvation is visible before it bites) and a `futile_rules` list naming
  every rule that holds abundant analyst-confirmed precedent yet still routes its cases to
  a human, with the two remedies that *can* work — enrich the source, or apply an analyst
  rule policy. Each becomes a `precedent_not_effective:{rule}` warning on the existing
  alerts list, so it also reaches the Overview degradation strip. Precedent projected
  before rule identity existed is reported separately as `unattributed_documents` rather
  than counted as absent. The Console's **Analytics → Effectiveness** health panel adds a
  "Precedent by rule" tile.
- **Durable application background jobs.** `POST /api/jobs` now admits self-scoped,
  idempotent long work into one bounded strict-CAS StateStore registry. Renewable
  five-minute leases, audit-before-effect and audit-before-visible transitions, restart recovery, live-grant
  checkpoints, cooperative cancellation, terminal compaction, bounded failure details,
  actor-scoped Inbox/SSE progress, polling fallback, and verified persistent ZIP
  artifacts cover Case Manager bulk lifecycle/reinvestigation/assignment/tagging, Data
  export archive/segment, precedent bootstrap, Runbook reindex, Knowledge import, tiered
  reset, and Storage lifecycle apply. The Console's **Analytics → Jobs** page is open to
  ordinary authenticated Inbox users for their own work, conditionally adds related LLM
  Batch rows for `models:read`, and adds list-only worker health for threshold tuning,
  campaign correlation, Batch cadence loops, and the event-driven `baseline_producer`
  (`cadence=on_ingest`) for `automation:read`. Newly accepted local LLM Batch rows freeze a strict, maximum-200,
  generation-bound active effective-`models:read` audience and reconcile one stable safe
  progress/terminal Inbox note per recipient. Authorization-store outage stays pending;
  permission/generation loss revokes the note; later users/grants and legacy rows remain
  list-only. Batch notes expose bounded provider/model/count copy only and have no Cancel,
  Download, or completion toast. The audience/outbox path is regression-backed across
  strict-store outage, stable retry, revocation, account replacement, and reset fencing.
  Case-result links are strict, privacy-bounded status/assignee/
  tag context filters—not immutable exact cohorts. The updater's separate private-
  supervisor job protocol is unchanged. Factory reset replaces prior Jobs/Inbox/artifact
  state with one privileged actorless sanitized receipt. In the supported single-backend-
  process profile it drains HTTP/SSE mutation admission, quiesces producers and detached
  writers, strictly clears tenant stores/RAG/usage/audit/runtime overlays, and releases
  its fences only after the new receipt lineage is audited. A factory privacy failure
  keeps the application fenced/degraded, blocks ordinary work, and permits only a new
  freshly authorized factory retry. Successful submit/retry/cancel `202` responses and
  terminal Inbox/SSE projection wait for their transition audit; reconciliation repairs
  audit gaps before projection. Retired direct reset and
  storage-apply mutations return 410; `POST /api/jobs` is the canonical mutation path.
  Direct archive/segment export, precedent bootstrap, RAG import, and full-catalog
  Runbook reindex remain executable OpenAPI-deprecated compatibility primitives;
  Console/user workflows use Jobs, while targeted Runbook reindex remains direct.
- **Durable one-file, server-assembled portable export.** The direct
  `POST /api/admin/export/archive` walks the same safe scopes and bounded pages as the
  resumable segment contract, writes
  one NDJSON member per scope plus a terminal provenance-bearing `manifest.json` into a
  stdlib ZIP on temporary server disk, and serves it only after every selected scope has
  emitted its starting count under its declared consistency. Elasticsearch retains its fixed PIT; PostgreSQL reports the honest
  non-exact `bounded_at_start` view and KV collections remain `live_values_at_read`.
  Permission and fresh-auth are rechecked before response creation, a strict append-only
  audit row records the prepared artifact (not client receipt), and temporary files/PITs are released on success,
  failure, cancellation, or disconnect. The Console now submits either
  `data_export_archive` or `data_export_segment` to the application-job registry; both
  complete server-side and retain one verified ZIP behind `artifact_id`, while segment
  mode follows and packages all numbered envelopes without a browser loop. The direct
  archive/segment routes remain executable OpenAPI-deprecated compatibility primitives,
  and the legacy bounded v1 route remains a compatibility contract.
- **Producing-build provenance on operational records.** Every newly created case carries
  immutable creation-build `app_version` and `build_sha`; re-investigation preserves those
  original values. Every new append-only audit and usage row carries the build that first
  appended it, and idempotent retries preserve the first writer's stamp. The fields reuse
  the non-secret `/api/health/build-info` identity: the application version comes from the
  running code, and a missing `TLSOC_BUILD_SHA` remains the honest literal `unknown`.
  Historical records remain `null` and are never attributed to the build that merely reads
  or updates them.
- **Evidence-qualified knowledge-reference coverage in `GET /api/metrics`.** The additive
  `retrieval_history` block reports case-level reference coverage only: investigated cases
  that ever recorded at least one reference divided by cases with at least one completed,
  instrumented retrieval attempt, proven by `retrieval_observation_status=measured`. Array
  presence alone is never evidence. It is not retrieval quality and not a per-run hit rate.
  A truncated read or any investigated case with lifetime history unavailable keeps the
  count/rate `null` and `unavailable`; a history-complete cohort with no measured attempt
  is `insufficient_evidence`. History-complete `not_measured` cases are excluded rather
  than counted as zero.
- **`GET /api/diagnostics/health`** (auth + `settings:read`) — the operator roll-up for the
  conditions that used to fail silently: precedent-corpus size and per-source counts, an
  explicit "0 analyst-confirmed precedents available" flag, the analyst-confirmed ground
  truth actually present in case history (so a labelling gap is distinguishable from a
  broken projection), the SQL schema-migration state with its remediation SQL, and
  auto-close health. It returns **separate `alerts` and `unknowns` lists** and no composite
  score, so "nothing is wrong" and "nothing could be measured" stay different answers. It
  is read-only and seed-free — asking about corpus health never triggers an embedding
  spend — and it is deliberately not on the unauthenticated `GET /api/health`, which is
  byte-identical.
- **`GET /api/metrics/auto-close-health`** (auth + `metrics:view`) — the rolling auto-close
  rate as a first-class signal with one explicit status: `disabled`, `no_volume`,
  `collapsed`, `never_fired`, `degraded`, `insufficient_evidence`, or `ok`. A near-zero
  rate only means an outage while decided volume holds steady, which is what separates
  "auto-close died" from "quiet night"; thin evidence reports an unavailable rate and a
  reason rather than a healthy-looking number.
- **Console: one shared Agent-health authority with a focused home.** The complete
  diagnostics roll-up now lives above **Analytics → Effectiveness** and follows that
  tab's 24h/7d/30d range at the stable `#/metrics?tab=effectiveness` URL. Overview uses
  the same reducer but renders only one compact strip for a positively detected
  degradation; healthy, unsupported, or unauthorized signals take no dashboard space,
  and unknown/unmeasured evidence remains distinct from healthy. Each endpoint keeps
  its independent `settings:read` or `metrics:view` grant, and superseded health reads
  cannot cross ranges.
- **An opt-in, default-off lower-trust precedent tier.** A fully autonomous deployment
  produces no analyst-confirmed outcomes, so its precedent corpus is permanently empty:
  auto-close depends on precedent, precedent depends on analyst labels, and analyst labels
  only exist if somebody works a queue the product exists to keep empty. The escape hatch is
  a separate, explicitly weaker tier — `rag.use_unconfirmed_resolved_cases` — that indexes
  the agent's own auto-closed verdicts as a distinct `model_unconfirmed` class, never a
  loosening of the analyst-confirmed gate, which is untouched. Four composing guards
  (confidence floor, minimum recurrence, age-out, context-share cap) plus a rank penalty and
  an unconditional ordering invariant stop the agent's own drift being fed back to it as
  evidence. Both tiers remain UNTRUSTED-fenced (#9) and render under headings that cannot be
  confused. `POST /api/rag/precedent/bootstrap` bulk-ratifies a backlog — permission-gated,
  audited, bounded, idempotent, dry-runnable, and requiring an exact acknowledgement string —
  and writes a history event that is deliberately invisible to the analyst-outcome
  classifier, so the threshold tuner sees exactly what it saw before.
- **Console: the tier and its guards in Knowledge settings**, labelled lower-trust and
  off by default, and described as feeding the agent prior model judgements rather than
  analyst decisions.
- **Console: the tuning inertness reason** wherever per-rule noise is shown, so a noisy
  rule that receives no correlation-threshold recommendation says why instead of going
  silent. `GET /api/tuning/recommendations` rule rows gained the additive
  `correlation_n_inert`, `correlation_n_inert_reason` and `correlation_n_inert_detail`
  fields.
- **Console: the analyst-comment disclosure.** A note written on a close or a
  confirm-false-positive, and a comment written on the AI grading, are embedded into the
  resolved-case precedent chunk and read back by the investigator on similar future cases.
  In production an ordinary operational aside became durable evidence and depressed
  investigator confidence to just under the auto-close bar, so nothing closed — the text was
  well-formed, and its meaning was the problem, which no amount of sanitising could have
  caught. Both fields now carry a short label saying what the note becomes.

- **`POST /api/proposals/bulk-reject`** (`proposals:approve`) — clearing a stale queue no
  longer means one request per proposal. Bounded to 200 ids with a mandatory reason, it
  reuses the single-reject body per proposal so every rejection still goes through the
  strict append-only audit path, and reports per-item outcomes so one bad item never
  aborts the batch. The field report asked for this to *avoid* the strict-audit path
  because that path was broken; it is fixed now, and bypassing it would have traded a
  fixed bug for a permanent hole in the audit log.

### Changed

- **The sign-in surface gained two identity accents, rebuilt from first principles.**
  The primary CTA is now a gradient-faced `ShineButton`: a blurred cyan-to-orchid halo
  sits rotated and invisible at rest and un-rotates into place on hover or keyboard
  focus, a soft gradient blob sweeps the face once per interaction, and the label is
  gradient-clipped until hover flattens it to solid white. The corner appearance
  control is now a `ThemeModePill` that names the mode you are in — a crescent on the
  left and a disc on the right scale-swap, the label slides toward whichever glyph is
  showing, and two blurred orbs behind the pill trade sides on every toggle. Both are
  pure CSS scoped to `.login-auth-canvas`; no animation library is involved and neither
  lands on a lazy chunk, so first paint is unchanged. The CTA also moved to the
  full-width 48px geometry the page's other primary actions already used.
  All three theme modes remain reachable: the pill reflects and sets the *resolved*
  appearance, and a round *Use system theme* reset beside it keeps `system` a first-class
  choice.
- **Login accent colour is now measured and gated, not chosen by eye.** These are the
  only surfaces in the console that paint text on a raw gradient rather than a semantic
  token pair, so the existing token-contrast gate is structurally blind to them. A new
  `login accents` design gate re-derives the worst case straight from `theme.css` on
  every `npm run gates` and every Vitest run: it composites each face stop with the
  sweep at its peak keyframe opacity and the overlay tint at its declared per-theme
  opacity, measures against both label stops, and samples the pill's label zone across
  the span the sliding label can actually occupy. All 362 composites clear 4.5:1. The
  ramps these are modelled on do not — which is exactly why the shipped ones are deeper.
- **The login focus ring is visible again.** The identity canvas overrode `--ring` to a
  grey measuring 1.84:1 on the white slab, well under the 3:1 WCAG 2.4.11 bar for a
  focus indicator. Light is now 4.74:1 and dark 5.65:1, which every control on the
  canvas inherits. The indicator is also drawn on each accent's opaque child rather
  than on the button, because an element's outer box-shadow paints before its
  descendants — a ring on the button sat underneath the halo, on exactly the state that
  shows the ring.
- **The login accents survive forced-colors mode.** `forced-color-adjust: none` opts an
  element out of the UA's own correction, so any state selector that outranked the
  fallback on specificity kept a hard-coded colour the system theme never sees: the
  appearance pill's dark-state navy ink, and the disabled CTA's muted face and label.
  The disabled CTA is the resting state of the password step, so that was the default
  rendering, not an edge case. Both now hand back to `ButtonFace`/`ButtonText`, with
  `GrayText` for the genuinely inert state.
- **A submitting sign-in button no longer looks like a dead one.** The CTA is disabled
  both while nothing is typed and while the request is in flight; the inert treatment
  now excludes the busy state, so clicking Sign in keeps the gradient and shows the
  spinner instead of flattening to grey.
- **The top KPI is Critical alone**, not Critical/High, and deep-links to that
  severity.
- **Demo mode moved into the top bar.** The banner took a full-width strip above
  every route; a compact pill now sits beside the release badge on every viewport,
  its popover keeping the isolation explanation and the Reset and Exit-and-clear
  actions.

- **The landing dashboard is now the "Cyber Defence Center"** (renamed from
  "Security Command Center"; the exported constant and boot-guard anchor are
  unchanged, and append-only history keeps the old name). The design pass unifies the
  band framing across the KPI strip, instrument band, and operations band, gives the
  burndown chart a real legend, and discloses the new hover-trend affordance in a
  quiet footnote — all inside the existing token system.
- **The false-positive-rate tile no longer shows a comparison percentage.** The delta
  chip compared against the previous window without saying so; it and its footnote are
  removed (the Analytics posture page's compare machinery is untouched).

- **Proposals carry an evidence fingerprint and derived provenance.** A proposal records a
  deterministic fingerprint over the keys defining its recommendation and over the
  analyst-sample counts with their provenance, and approval refuses a mismatch with a
  machine-readable code rather than applying stale reasoning. `analyst_samples` is now
  broken down into independent analyst outcomes, feedback labels, explicit dispositions,
  bulk-ratified model verdicts, and unlabelled cases — and that provenance is **derived,
  never self-declared**, so a payload claiming independent evidence while carrying only
  bulk ratifications is still reported as `bulk_ratified` and is unapprovable. Bulk
  ratifications are counted out of the sample total, so they cannot move a threshold. This
  is the defect that let a backfill present model verdicts as analyst-confirmed evidence.
  **Every pre-existing pending tuning proposal that would apply a change is therefore
  unapprovable until re-drafted** — deliberately, because those are precisely the rows
  whose analyst labels may be backfilled model verdicts.
- **Lapsed proposals expire.** `expires_at` existed but nothing swept it and expired
  proposals still rendered as actionable. A lapsed row is now projected as `expired` at
  read time (a view, never a write, so a failed sweep costs durability but never honesty)
  and swept durably. Approving an expired proposal is refused at the claim, before any
  audit row or effect; rejecting one stays available, which is what makes a queue
  clearable. Suppression proposals are exempt, because their `expires_at` is the lifetime
  of the rule approval materialises rather than a review deadline.
- Analyst notes carried into a precedent chunk are bounded and flattened, so an
  operational note cannot reshape the corpus. Where the bulk projection has no
  caller-supplied note it recovers the note already persisted on the case, so a
  reprojection no longer blanks every note.
- Approval audit summaries now record `decision=authorized effect=pending
  finalization=pending`, so a row never claims a confirmed effect before it has run.

### Upgrade notes

- **No version bump, SQL migration, or historical backfill is required for record
  provenance or retrieval history.** The change is additive under the existing `0.1.13`
  source version. PostgreSQL and SQLite keep these fields inside existing JSON documents.
  Legacy `app_version` and `build_sha` values remain `null`.
  The Case wire contract continues to return `knowledge_used` as an array. Legacy
  `retrieval_history_status` remains `unavailable`; the new observation
  marker starts `unavailable` rather than being inferred from the historical array. A
  later fully measured modern run may advance `retrieval_observation_status` to
  `measured`, but it cannot reconstruct or change the lifetime-history marker.
- **Existing Elasticsearch templates and indices are not automatically remapped.** New
  installations receive the additive provenance/retrieval fields from the current bundled
  templates. Existing installations must update the Agentic SOC-owned templates and
  mappings through their normal Elasticsearch change process if explicit mappings are
  required; ordinary boot only creates missing templates/indices and does not reindex or
  mutate existing ones. Dynamic mapping may accept the fields, but that is not equivalent
  to applying the shipped templates retrospectively.
- **PostgreSQL deployments are migrated in place at boot** (`audit.id` → `bigint`, with the
  sequence widened); the migration is idempotent, preserves rows, and never blocks boot. If
  it fails it logs at ERROR with the exact remediation SQL and reports a `failed` state on
  the new diagnostics endpoint. If you apply that SQL by hand, do **not** apply it against a
  running backend: each pooled connection will raise one transient
  `InvalidCachedStatementError` on its next use because its cached plan no longer matches
  the column type. Restart the backend after a manual `ALTER`.
- **The approval audit `result_summary` text changed.** A proposal left mid-decision across
  the upgrade — one whose `…:approve` audit row was written by pre-fix code and never
  finalised — will collide with the new summary on retry and needs an administrator to
  clear it. This cannot occur on PostgreSQL, where no such row could ever have been written
  in the first place.
- **Disabling `rag.use_resolved_cases` no longer deletes precedent chunks.** They remain in
  the store and simply stop being retrievable, so re-enabling the source restores the
  accumulated corpus instead of starting from nothing.
- **The precedent projection window is now shared fairly across detection rules.** This
  changes WHICH analyst-confirmed cases are projected on the next re-seed — the window size
  is unchanged (`precedent.window.size`, 200), but a rule that previously took every slot
  now keeps a proportional share. Set `precedent.window.stratify_by_rule` to `false` to
  restore the previous newest-first behaviour.
- **Existing precedent is re-tagged with rule identity on the next projection.** The
  re-tag reads rule ids from the case store (never parsed out of chunk prose), reuses the
  existing document identity, and does not re-embed, so it costs no gateway spend. Chunks
  whose case can no longer be read are left alone and reported as
  `unattributed_documents` — they stay retrievable but cannot be rule-matched, so
  precedent promotion will not count them until their case is re-confirmed or re-indexed.
- **`DecisionBy` has a fourth value, `analyst_policy`.** It appears only on cases closed by
  an operator's analyst rule policy, so nothing changes until a declaration exists. Any
  integration that switches exhaustively on `decision_by` should treat it as neither agent
  nor human: it is excluded from agent-performance statistics by design, and treating it as
  an analyst outcome would let the automation train on its own output.
- **An analyst rule policy never applies to a case the agent has already investigated.**
  A cluster signature is entity-centric and excludes rule ids, so a later alert carrying
  only a declared rule can re-enter an open case. A case that already carries a verdict is
  left entirely alone, and coverage is checked against the rule set the closed record will
  actually carry (cluster + case), so an undeclared detection can never be absorbed into a
  no-model close. Analyst-owned state on an un-investigated case — grades, tags, comments,
  assignment — survives the close.
- **A grade recorded on a policy-closed case is ground truth but not agent quality.** It
  counts for the threshold tuner and the precedent corpus (an analyst labelled the alert),
  and is excluded from agreement/correction rates (no model judged it, so agreeing or
  disagreeing with it measures nothing about the agent).
- **Precedent promotion is OFF by default and must be enabled deliberately.** It changes
  what the investigator is told, so it is not adopted silently on upgrade. The window
  fairness fix and the futility report are read-side only and are on.
- **Pending tuning proposals drafted before this release cannot be approved.** They carry
  no evidence fingerprint, so they are reported as `unverified` and refused with
  `evidence_fingerprint_missing`. Reject them (bulk reject is the fast path) and let the
  tuner re-draft against verifiable evidence. On the first run after deploying, a rule with
  a stale pending proposal may briefly show both the old row and its honest re-draft; the
  old one lapses at its own expiry and is then swept.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-08-05

**Canonical legacy-bootstrap identity correction.** The immutable `v0.1.12`
release passed protected source and tag CI, published the complete signed release,
and exposed all three public digest-pinned images. Canonical v0.1.1 runtime
acceptance then failed closed before any application mutation because those final
pre-supervisor backend and Web images both legitimately omit the state-schema OCI
label. The supervisor normalized the missing backend value to `unknown` but compared
the raw missing Web value, incorrectly treating two matching legacy identities as a
mismatch.

### Fixed

- The updater now normalizes an absent state-schema label on both installed
  application components to the same explicit `unknown` value before coherence
  comparison. This admits only the existing one-time v0.1.1 host-bootstrap path.
- A mixed deployment, where only one component carries the state-schema label, still
  fails identity coherence. Any post-v0.1.1 deployment without the exact Stable
  channel, immutable revision, and schema-1 labels still fails the managed-identity
  and state-schema gates.
- Regression coverage exercises matching absent legacy labels and the mixed-label
  rejection in addition to the existing preflight tests for the v0.1.1 exception and
  unmanaged later releases.

### Release boundary

- No application-state migration, updater-protocol change, signed-plan schema
  change, Sigstore identity/issuer change, privilege expansion, or frozen-base
  change is introduced. `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` remains byte-identical
  with updater-protocol-1 SHA-256
  `e3f7ecbb0f749cc9d88f4392c58c9a63ddbd064e80ecde9f21fe9de199086fd4`.
- Version 0.1.13 must repeat the complete protected Testing/main/tag, signed-publication,
  anonymous-pull, signature, canonical v0.1.1 bootstrap, supervisor-receipt, and
  browser-acceptance gates under a fresh immutable tag.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-08-05

**Governed constrained-verifier cleanup correction.** The immutable `v0.1.11`
candidate passed protected `Testing`, promoted-`main`, and exact-tag CI. Its
signed-release workflow built and pushed all three dual-platform images, signed and
verified every immutable digest, proved credential-free registry access and release
labels, generated and signed the canonical release plan, and successfully verified
that plan both on the host and inside the production-constrained updater. The
workflow then failed while its exit trap tried to unlink the mode-`0444`
verification files from their runner-owned parent directory, which still had mode
`0555`:

```text
Verified OK
rm: cannot remove '.../upgrade-plan.sigstore.json': Permission denied
rm: cannot remove '.../upgrade-plan.json': Permission denied
```

Publication therefore stopped before attestations, the GitHub Release, canonical
plan assets, Stable convenience tags, or Stable Help Center. No deployment switch
began. The tag is immutable evidence, but it is non-installable and must never be
moved, reused, or repaired.

### Fixed

- Release-fixture cleanup now preserves the verifier's original result, disables
  recursive EXIT handling, requests removal of the exact verifier container, and
  proves that exact anchored container name is absent before removing volumes or
  relaxing the bind source. Docker ambiguity fails closed and retains the fixture.
  After absence is proven, cleanup guards the runner-owned directory, restores only
  its original private mode `0700`, and removes it. The plan and Sigstore bundle
  remain mode `0444` beneath a mode-`0555` directory for the full duration of
  production-constrained verification; a cleanup failure promotes only an otherwise
  successful step and never masks an earlier release failure.
- The cleanup is deliberately post-verification workflow hygiene. It does not
  weaken the shipping updater, broaden file permissions during verification, or
  change the verifier's content, signature, identity, issuer, or compatibility
  checks.

### Release boundary

- There is no application behavior change, state-schema migration,
  updater-protocol change, signed-plan schema change, Sigstore certificate identity
  or issuer change, process-privilege change, or frozen-base change.
  `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` retains updater-protocol-1 SHA-256
  `e3f7ecbb0f749cc9d88f4392c58c9a63ddbd064e80ecde9f21fe9de199086fd4`.
- Version 0.1.12 repeats every `Testing`, promotion, `main`, exact-tag,
  signed-publication, canonical bootstrap, and browser-acceptance gate under a new
  immutable identity. It is not installable until all those gates complete.

### Publication outcome

- Protected Testing, main, and exact-tag CI passed; the complete public GitHub
  Release, signed plan and bundle, three dual-platform digest-pinned images,
  anonymous reads, keyless signatures, and Stable documentation all published and
  independently verified.
- Canonical v0.1.1 bootstrap then failed closed during preflight because both legacy
  application images omit the state-schema OCI label and the updater compared one
  normalized absence with one raw absence. No application switch, database backup,
  or state mutation began. The immutable release is cryptographically valid but is
  bootstrap-blocked and superseded by 0.1.13; never move, reuse, or repair its tag.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-05

**Governed native-builder portability correction.** The immutable `v0.1.10`
candidate passed protected `Testing`, promoted-`main`, and exact-tag CI, then its
signed-release job reached the fail-closed 120-minute timeout while building the
dual-platform Web Console image. The Python documentation and Node application
builder stages were architecture-independent but had not declared BuildKit's native
build platform, so the arm64 target ran `npm ci` through target emulation on the
amd64-hosted runner until timeout. No application update began, and the workflow did
not publish a complete three-image set, signatures, canonical signed plan,
attestations, GitHub Release, Stable convenience tags, or Stable Help Center.

### Fixed

- The Web Console's documentation and application builder stages now use
  `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM`, while the final nginx runtime keeps no platform
  override and therefore inherits Docker's requested target platform.
  Architecture-neutral package installation and asset compilation therefore run
  natively without changing the real linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 runtime manifest.
- The fail-closed CI policy parses the shipping Dockerfile and requires both named
  builders to remain native and the unnamed final runtime to remain target-specific,
  in addition to the existing digest-pin checks.

### Release boundary

- There is no application behavior change, state-schema migration,
  updater-protocol change, signed-plan schema change, Sigstore certificate identity
  or issuer change, process-privilege change, or frozen-base change.
  `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` retains updater-protocol-1 SHA-256
  `e3f7ecbb0f749cc9d88f4392c58c9a63ddbd064e80ecde9f21fe9de199086fd4`.
- The immutable `v0.1.10` tag and partial backend candidate remain historical
  evidence. Because its release job timed out before the complete signed image set,
  canonical signed-plan assets, GitHub Release, Stable convenience tags, and Stable
  Help Center existed, it is non-installable and must never be moved, reused, or
  repaired. Version 0.1.11 repeats every Testing, promotion, `main`, exact-tag,
  signed-publication, canonical bootstrap, and browser-acceptance gate under a new
  immutable identity.

### Publication outcome

- The immutable `v0.1.11` tag passed protected source and exact-tag CI. Its release
  workflow built, pushed, anonymously read, signed, and verified all three image
  digests, then generated, signed, and verified the canonical plan on the host and
  inside the constrained updater.
- The post-verification cleanup trap could not unlink the read-only plan files while
  their runner-owned parent directory remained non-writable. The
  workflow failed closed before attestations, GitHub Release publication, canonical
  asset publication, Stable tags, or Stable documentation. No application update
  began. Preserve `v0.1.11` as immutable evidence, but never install, bootstrap,
  move, reuse, or repair it; version 0.1.12 is the separately governed cleanup
  correction.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-05

**Governed Stable-publication fixture portability correction.** The immutable
`v0.1.9` workflow passed exact-tag CI, built and pushed all three public
multi-platform component images, signed their immutable digests, verified
credential-free registry access, generated and signed the canonical upgrade plan,
and verified that plan on the host. The next fail-closed gate started the real
digest-pinned updater with the production `read_only`, `cap_drop: ALL`, and
`no-new-privileges` restrictions, but the container could not traverse the
runner-owned `mktemp` directory used for the read-only `/verification` bind mount:

```text
Error: open /verification/upgrade-plan.json: permission denied
```

The application switch never began. The workflow did not publish attestations, the
GitHub Release, the two signed-plan assets, Stable convenience tags, or Stable
documentation. Version 0.1.10 preserves every immutable 0.1.9 object as historical
evidence and corrects only this release-test fixture boundary.

### Fixed

- Stable publication now installs `upgrade-plan.json` and
  `upgrade-plan.sigstore.json` into the temporary verification directory with mode
  `0444`, removes directory write access with mode `0555`, and only then mounts that
  directory read-only into the constrained updater. The files are therefore
  readable and the directory traversable by the shipping `0:10001` process even
  after every Linux capability is dropped.
- The release contract statically enforces the exact least-privilege preparation
  order and rejects broad permission/ownership workarounds, recursive permission
  changes, source `cp`, runtime entrypoint overrides, or privilege expansion. The
  constrained container also asserts that both verification inputs are readable
  before running `cosign verify-blob`.

### Release boundary

- There is no application-state migration, updater-protocol change, signed-plan
  schema change, Sigstore certificate-identity or issuer change, process-privilege
  change, or frozen-base change. The updater still runs as `0:10001` with all Linux
  capabilities dropped, and `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` retains protocol
  1 SHA-256
  `e3f7ecbb0f749cc9d88f4392c58c9a63ddbd064e80ecde9f21fe9de199086fd4`.
- The immutable `v0.1.9` tag and its signed public digest images remain factual
  partial-publication evidence. Because its workflow stopped before attestations,
  GitHub Release publication, signed-plan asset publication, Stable convenience
  tags, and Stable Help Center publication, it is not installable and must never be
  moved, reused, or repaired. Version 0.1.10 repeats every Testing, promotion,
  `main`, exact-tag, signed-publication, canonical bootstrap, and browser-acceptance
  gate under a new immutable identity.

### Publication outcome

- The immutable `v0.1.10` tag passed protected `Testing`, promoted-`main`, and
  exact-tag CI. Signed-release run `30997996274` built the backend candidate and
  began the dual-platform Web Console build, where arm64 `npm ci` ran under target
  emulation until the workflow's 120-minute fail-closed timeout.
- No application switch began. The workflow did not publish a complete Web
  Console/updater candidate set, the complete image signature set, canonical plan
  and bundle, attestations, a GitHub Release, Stable convenience tags, or Stable
  Help Center. Preserve the tag and partial registry object as immutable historical
  evidence, but never install or bootstrap 0.1.10. Version 0.1.11 is the separately
  governed native-builder portability correction.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-05

**Governed Sigstore trust-root portability correction.** The immutable `v0.1.8`
release completed exact-tag CI, public signed multi-platform images, the canonical
signed plan and bundle, the GitHub Release, and the versioned Help Center. Canonical
PostgreSQL Compose bootstrap then reached signed-plan verification inside the
read-only updater container and exposed a separate cosign 3 runtime defect: its
default TUF cache path was `/root/.sigstore`, which is not writable under the frozen
`read_only: true` supervisor runtime. The application switch did not begin. Version
0.1.9 preserves the complete 0.1.8 publication record and corrects that trust-state
location without changing application state, updater protocol 1, publisher identity,
process privilege, or the frozen base Compose file.

### Fixed

- The shipping updater image now bakes
  `TUF_ROOT=/var/lib/agentic-soc-updater/sigstore-root`, placing cosign's TUF trust
  state on the existing writable updater-state volume instead of the read-only root
  filesystem. The release plan and image signatures keep the same keyless workflow
  identity and issuer checks.
- Bootstrap now reuses an idle supervisor only when its reported updater version
  matches the target release in addition to protocol, capability, and readiness
  checks. A healthy but mismatched 0.1.8 supervisor is therefore replaced by the
  exact 0.1.9 updater before plan verification; active, unreadable, or invalid state
  still fails closed.
- Shipping-image acceptance proves the baked TUF root exists on the writable state
  volume, and Stable publication verifies the signed canonical plan inside the real
  digest-pinned updater under the production `read-only`, `cap_drop: ALL`, and
  `no-new-privileges` constraints before the GitHub Release becomes public.

### Release boundary

- There is no state-schema migration, updater-protocol change, publisher-identity
  change, privilege expansion, or frozen-base change. The updater still runs as
  `0:10001`, all Linux capabilities remain dropped, and
  `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` retains its protocol-1 SHA-256
  `e3f7ecbb0f749cc9d88f4392c58c9a63ddbd064e80ecde9f21fe9de199086fd4`.
- The immutable `v0.1.8` tag, images, signatures, plan, bundle, GitHub Release, and
  Help Center remain historical evidence. Its canonical bootstrap is unsupported
  because cosign cannot initialize its default trust cache on the read-only root
  filesystem. Never move or reuse that tag.

### Publication outcome

- The immutable `v0.1.9` tag passed exact-tag CI. Its workflow built, pushed, and
  keylessly signed all three multi-platform image digests; verified the exact
  manifests anonymously; generated, signed, and host-verified the canonical plan;
  and then failed inside the real constrained updater because the runner-owned
  `/verification` bind source was not traversable after capabilities were dropped.
- No application update started. Attestations, the GitHub Release, canonical plan
  and bundle assets, Stable convenience tags, and Stable Help Center publication
  were skipped. Preserve the tag and digest objects as immutable historical
  evidence, but never use 0.1.9 for deployment or bootstrap. Version 0.1.10 later
  timed out during the emulated Web Console build; the separately gated 0.1.11
  release repeats the complete sequence with both corrections.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-05

**Published Docker Desktop control-socket portability correction with a later
Sigstore trust-root defect.** The immutable
`v0.1.7` release completed exact-tag CI, published public signed component images,
the canonical signed upgrade plan and bundle, the GitHub Release, and versioned
documentation. Canonical PostgreSQL Compose acceptance then exposed a separate
supervisor-start failure: the 0.1.7 updater image had no `USER` instruction, so the
process ran as UID/GID 0:0 and attempted to change the new Unix control socket to
0:10001 while every Linux capability was dropped. Docker Desktop correctly denied
that `chown`. Version 0.1.8 preserves the complete publication record and corrects
the least-privilege runtime boundary without an application-state migration or base
Compose change.

The immutable 0.1.8 publication then completed its exact-tag CI, public signed
images, canonical signed plan and bundle, GitHub Release, and Help Center. Canonical
bootstrap reached signed-plan verification inside the read-only updater container,
where cosign 3 attempted to initialize its default TUF cache at `/root/.sigstore`.
That path is not writable under the frozen runtime, so bootstrap stopped before the
application switch. Preserve every 0.1.8 artifact as immutable evidence. Version
0.1.9 corrected the trust-root path but failed later in its constrained verification
fixture. Version 0.1.10 later timed out during the emulated Web Console build;
0.1.11 is the separately gated publication correction.

### Fixed

- The updater image starts its control-plane process with UID 0 and application
  group 10001 while retaining `cap_drop: ALL`. The process therefore creates the
  private control socket with the required application-readable group directly,
  rather than depending on a forbidden post-bind ownership change.
- Control-socket publication now validates the bound object fail closed before
  serving: `lstat` must report a Unix socket with UID 0 and configured GID 10001;
  the supervisor then sets its mode to `0660`. An unexpected object, owner, or group
  stops startup instead of silently widening access.
- Shipping-image acceptance exercises the real updater image with its capabilities
  removed and verifies the socket's type and metadata from the backend-facing mount,
  so source-only tests cannot substitute for the Docker Desktop runtime boundary.

### Release boundary

- The frozen `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` remains byte-identical to updater
  protocol 1. Release-specific backend, Console, and updater pins remain exclusively
  in the signed, supervisor-generated override.
- The published `v0.1.7` tag, public images, signatures, plan, bundle, GitHub Release,
  and Help Center remain immutable historical evidence. Its canonical bootstrap is
  unsupported because the supervisor cannot publish a usable control socket. Never
  move or reuse that tag. The later `v0.1.8` publication corrected this socket
  boundary but remained bootstrap-blocked at cosign's read-only default TUF cache.
  Version 0.1.9 corrected that path but failed later in its constrained verification
  fixture. Version 0.1.10 later timed out during the emulated Web Console build.
  Version 0.1.11 reached constrained verification but failed closed during
  post-verification cleanup and is immutable and non-installable; only a later,
  fully accepted Stable release may authorize installation.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-05

**Published, signed Stable artifact set with a Docker Desktop supervisor-start
defect.** This patch preserved the immutable, signed `v0.1.6` publication record and
republished its accepted product scope after repairing the macOS Bash 3.2 bootstrap.
Exact-tag CI, public signed images, the signed plan and bundle, GitHub Release, and
Help Center completed. Canonical acceptance then found that `cap_drop: ALL` blocks
the updater's unconditional control-socket ownership change. The application
workload remained on its prior release. The tag and artifacts remain immutable;
`v0.1.8` corrected this socket boundary but remained bootstrap-blocked during
Sigstore trust initialization. Version 0.1.9 corrected that path but failed later
in its constrained verification fixture. Version 0.1.10 later timed out during the
emulated Web Console build; `v0.1.11` is the governed publication correction.

### Added

- A required `macos-14` CI lane executes the shipping updater-start helper with
  Apple's Bash 3.2 for both first installation and `--force-recreate`, in addition
  to syntax and static contract checks. The fail-closed `CI passed` aggregate now
  requires this nineteenth visible status check.

### Fixed

- `scripts/bootstrap-updater.sh` no longer expands an empty optional Bash array
  under `set -u`. The helper now forwards zero or one explicit Compose arguments
  through `"$@"`, so a clean canonical v0.1.1 PostgreSQL deployment can install the
  private supervisor before delegating the complete transition to the signed plan.

### Release boundary

- The frozen `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` remains byte-identical to updater
  protocol 1. Release-specific backend, Console, and updater pins remain exclusively
  in the signed, supervisor-generated override.
- The published `v0.1.6` and `v0.1.7` tags and artifacts remain immutable evidence.
  Version 0.1.6 is blocked before supervisor installation by the Bash 3.2 host path;
  0.1.7 reaches the updater container but cannot publish the private control socket
  under its dropped-capability runtime. Do not move or reuse either tag. Version
  0.1.8 corrected that boundary but remained bootstrap-blocked at cosign's default
  read-only TUF cache. Version 0.1.9 corrected that path but failed later in its
  constrained verification fixture. Version 0.1.10 later timed out during the
  emulated Web Console build; 0.1.11 repeats the complete release and canonical
  bootstrap acceptance sequence.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-05

**Published, signed Stable artifact set with a canonical bootstrap portability
defect.** This patch republished the accepted 0.1.5 application scope without moving
or reusing that tag and repaired the anonymous multi-platform registry acceptance
boundary. Its exact-tag CI, public signed images, signed plan and bundle, GitHub
Release, and Help Center completed. Canonical acceptance subsequently found that the
clean-tag bootstrap exits on macOS Bash 3.2 before installing the supervisor. The
workload remains unchanged on that failure. The immutable tag and artifacts are
preserved. Version 0.1.7 repaired this Bash defect but exposed a later updater
control-socket startup failure. Version 0.1.8 corrected that boundary but remained
bootstrap-blocked during Sigstore trust initialization. Version 0.1.9 corrected the
trust-root path but failed later in its constrained verification fixture;
version 0.1.10 later timed out during the emulated Web Console build;
`v0.1.11` is the governed publication correction.

### Changed

- The anonymous GHCR release gate performs a real credential-free Docker pull for
  each required platform and removes the exact digest reference after every pull,
  preventing Docker's classic image store from retaining one architecture under the
  shared index name. Its independent registry verifier remains the authoritative
  acceptance proof: it fetches and hashes the exact index, both `linux/amd64` and
  `linux/arm64` child manifests, each referenced config, and every required release
  label.
- The complete Testing, promotion, `main`, exact annotated-tag, signed-image,
  anonymous-registry, signed-plan, and GitHub Release sequence was repeated for
  0.1.6. Canonical bootstrap acceptance was then attempted independently and failed
  before supervisor installation on macOS Bash 3.2; browser update acceptance could
  not begin. No 0.1.5 result substitutes for any 0.1.6 gate.

### Fixed

- Stable publication now evicts the immutable multi-architecture digest reference
  after each real platform pull. Retaining that reference caused the second platform
  pull in the `v0.1.5` workflow to conflict with the first even though the registry
  objects had already been built and signed.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-05

**Failed, non-installable publication attempt after the non-installable `v0.1.4`
attempt.** The immutable `v0.1.5` tag records the accepted application source and
the release workflow built and signed candidate component digests, but publication
stopped during its anonymous multi-platform pull gate before the canonical signed
upgrade plan, Sigstore plan bundle, public GitHub Release, or Stable convenience
tags were published. Those partial objects are not installation authority. The tag
must never be moved or reused. Version 0.1.6 was the next correction attempt; it
published successfully but exposed the Bash bootstrap defect fixed in 0.1.7.
Version 0.1.7 then exposed the updater control-socket defect corrected in 0.1.8;
0.1.8 was subsequently bootstrap-blocked by cosign's read-only default TUF cache.
Version 0.1.9 corrected that path but failed later in its constrained verification
fixture. Version 0.1.10 later timed out during the emulated Web Console build;
0.1.11 is the governed publication correction.

The attempted scope comprised supervised updates, public signed release artifacts,
broader Intelligence coverage, truthful operator states, honest rule authoring,
responsive Console hardening, and stricter release acceptance.

This release includes the accepted work from the unpublished 0.1.2 and 0.1.3
Testing snapshots and the exact accepted application scope from 0.1.4. Neither
Testing snapshot had an immutable tag, GitHub Release, signed upgrade plan, or
supported Stable artifacts. The immutable `v0.1.4` attempt published only its tag
and documentation; it produced no application release artifact.

### Added

- A complete immutable Stable publication contract: three multi-architecture,
  digest-pinned GHCR images (`backend`, `webui`, and `updater`), keyless Sigstore
  signatures bound to the exact tagged release workflow identity, a signed canonical
  `upgrade-plan.json` plus verification bundle, and an atomically published GitHub
  Release. Anonymous image access is verified before release publication so a private
  or missing package fails closed instead of producing a non-installable update.
- A supervised **one-click Stable update** foundation for the reference
  single-replica PostgreSQL Compose deployment. After one host bootstrap, a
  built-in super-admin can approve a server-bound preflight; an isolated updater
  verifies a signed declarative release plan and digest-pinned application images,
  blocks unsupported state/topology or non-durable secrets, pulls before mutation,
  creates and validates a PostgreSQL backup, replaces the backend and Web/installed
  Help Center as a coherent pair, verifies exact release identity and readiness,
  records durable progress and receipts, and automatically rolls back a failed
  switch or observation window. Unsupported deployments fail closed with manual
  remediation, and the browser and ordinary backend never receive the Docker socket,
  host commands, arbitrary artifacts, registry credentials, or migration authority.
- Protected Intelligence coverage now includes cloud-IAM compromise and
  data-exfiltration runbooks, exact-match cloud-identity, exfiltration, and
  ransomware response playbooks, and dedicated cloud-identity and data-protection
  personas. These remain advisory inputs to the shared agent engine; unrelated
  detections do not receive a procedure and deterministic case policy remains the
  final route authority.

### Changed

- Detection-rule authoring exposes only the single predicate and threshold controls
  the current runtime executes. Existing advisory MITRE, schedule, and suppression
  metadata continues to round-trip without being presented as active authoring.
- Console release acceptance now uses a strict streamed Vitest gate that fails on
  test errors, any stderr byte, or Vitest-captured console output.
- Release acceptance now exposes seventeen independent quality lanes plus a fail-closed
  aggregate, including real PostgreSQL+pgvector/Redis readiness and all three shipping
  container-image builds. Workflow/ShellCheck validation is isolated from
  deploy/updater contracts so an early error cannot mask later blockers.
- CI now rejects fatal Python correctness defects and fail-open workflow edits,
  including missing or unreviewed workflow files across both YAML extensions, mutable
  external actions, duplicate YAML keys, missing timeouts, `continue-on-error`, unsafe
  triggers, and aggregate dependency drift. ShellCheck is
  version-pinned and checksum-verified instead of inherited from the mutable runner.
- First-party checkout and runtime-setup actions use reviewed immutable Node
  24-compatible commit SHAs, with weekly Dependabot update proposals.
- Shipping Dockerfile bases are pinned to reviewed multi-platform manifest digests,
  with weekly Docker Dependabot update proposals.
- The shipping-image gate now starts the built Web Console container and requires its
  native health check plus an IPv4 HTTP probe to pass, rather than validating image
  metadata without exercising nginx.
- Stable artifacts and versioned Help Center publication both wait for the exact
  immutable tag's successful fail-closed CI aggregate.
- Shared empty states now distinguish first use, no data, no results, success,
  unavailable evidence, and request failure with accessible semantics.
- Detection & Rules uses a narrow-screen column contract, readable wrapping, and
  standard editor insets instead of forcing document-level horizontal scrolling.
- Release governance now requires every published change— including documentation,
  configuration, dependency, API, operational, behavioral, or visible UI changes—
  to ship under a new SemVer and matching patch notes. Multiple related commits may
  form one candidate; internal commits do not each mint a release or tag.

### Fixed

- The shipping backend now pins the build helper version compatible with its
  constrained runtime dependency graph and runs `pip check` both while building the
  image and against the final container in CI, eliminating a latent
  `wheel`/`packaging` inconsistency that source-environment tests could not observe.
- Stable publication now reads valid absent-release and absent-asset booleans without
  using `jq -e` to reinterpret JSON `false` as a shell failure. The release inventory
  classifier remains fail closed for malformed, ambiguous, unexpected, duplicate,
  incomplete, or non-canonical release state. The complete Testing, promotion, main,
  tag, signing, anonymous-pull, canonical-bootstrap, and browser gates are repeated
  for 0.1.5; no 0.1.4 acceptance result substitutes for the new candidate's gates.
- The updater now publishes a terminal job only after its lifecycle generation has
  settled, so an immediately requested rollback cannot overlap the completed update
  worker or observe an incomplete durable state transition.
- The shipping Web Console health check now probes nginx over explicit IPv4 loopback,
  matching the container listener instead of remaining unhealthy when Alpine resolves
  `localhost` to IPv6.
- The backend distribution test now accepts only the reviewed Python tag plus a
  64-character immutable image digest and the expected runtime stage, so Docker
  reproducibility hardening no longer makes the complete offline suite fail.
- The Overview accessibility smoke test now waits for its lazy KPI numerals to
  settle through Testing Library's act-aware lifecycle before taking the snapshot,
  eliminating a scheduling-sensitive React warning on slower Linux runners without
  suppressing Console output.
- The Web UI production-build step now declares and exports its generated build date
  separately, satisfying ShellCheck SC2155 on GitHub's runner instead of failing the
  workflow-validation lane before deployment and updater checks execute.
- Case Collaboration keeps last-good task, activity, and discussion evidence visible
  across refresh failures and offers endpoint-specific retries instead of displaying
  false empty states.
- A degraded Standup snapshot no longer celebrates an incomplete empty attention
  queue as a clear shift.
- The Rules workspace and Case Manager remain within the viewport on compact screens
  while retaining keyboard access and the canonical detail handoff.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-05 — failed, non-installable publication attempt

The accepted source tree, immutable annotated `v0.1.4` tag, exact-tag CI, Help Center,
and GitHub Pages deployment succeeded. The release publisher then stopped at its
initial empty-inventory boundary because `jq -e` returned exit 1 for the expected JSON
boolean `false`. No backend, Web Console, or updater release image was built or
published; no image or plan was signed; and no `upgrade-plan.json`, Sigstore bundle,
or GitHub Release exists. The tag is immutable historical evidence and must never be
moved or reused. See `docs/releases/0.1.4.md`; the first correction attempt, 0.1.5,
also remained non-installable. Versions 0.1.6, 0.1.7, and 0.1.8 published signed
artifact sets but remained bootstrap-blocked at successive boundaries. Version
0.1.9 corrected the last runtime defect but failed during its constrained release
fixture. Version 0.1.10 later timed out during the emulated Web Console build;
0.1.11 is the governed publication correction.

## Development snapshot — 2026-08-04 — 0.1.3 Testing candidate

Version 0.1.3 was prepared and accepted as Testing/main source but was never
published as an annotated Stable tag or GitHub Release. Its accepted delta is
included in the 0.1.5 attempt and 0.1.6 candidate above and was also present in the non-installable 0.1.4 publication
attempt. The historical operator record remains at
`docs/releases/0.1.3.md`; do not create `v0.1.3` retroactively.

## Development snapshot — 2026-08-03 — 0.1.2 Testing candidate

**Unpublished Testing snapshot — no immutable tag or Stable artifact: Security
Command Center, canonical Case Manager detail, governed continuous-improvement
inputs, durable Intelligence catalogs and Workspace Chat, portable export, safer
in-app release activation, and a version-matched Help Center.**

### Added

- An additive **Triage → Case Manager** split-pane workspace: Active/All queue,
  search/filter/sort, responsive embedded six-tab case detail, top-right Share /
  Take Action / close controls, multi-selection, and permission-gated bulk work.
  The established Cases page remains available while capability parity is phased in.
- Case Manager bulk actions are Acknowledge, Assign, Add tag, Set status,
  Set disposition, Reinvestigate, and Resolve. Successful cases leave the
  selection; per-case failures remain selected with their reason for retry. Raw
  Close is intentionally omitted from the bulk menu.
- Case Manager now conditionally exposes **Investigation inputs** from the latest
  investigation run: operator memory consulted, RAG knowledge retrieved, runbook
  references retrieved, playbooks actually injected and consulted, and immutable
  platform threshold-tuning snapshots. Earlier runs cannot leak into a later
  reinvestigation, selected-only playbooks stay hidden, missing provenance remains
  explicit, and threshold tuning is labelled separately from model fine-tuning.
  These inputs never replace deterministic case policy as the final route authority.
- Durable per-user **Workspace Chat history** over the selected state backend,
  with newest-first list/detail, search, selection, rename, and delete. A new
  conversation is persisted only after its first successful, verified state-store
  commit; the saved server transcript and each assistant turn's effective source/model
  are authoritative when it is resumed. Stable request identifiers make an ambiguous
  retry replay the one committed turn without appending or billing twice. Per-user live
  request leases are capped at 256; saturation fails before model invocation with a
  typed retryable response and recovers as leases complete or expire.
- An always-visible `vX.Y.Z · Testing|Stable` Console badge with a provenance
  popover for separate Console/backend channel, SHA, and build time. An identity
  mismatch can only downgrade the session to Testing.
- A fail-safe **Update available** control beside the release badge for activating
  a different Console release that has already been deployed. A no-store static
  manifest must exactly match healthy backend build-info before the offer appears;
  known unsaved drafts block confirmation, and a final manifest/backend/health/
  entry-document preflight preserves the current hash route only after every check
  passes. Discovery or activation failure leaves the current Console running. The
  browser never pulls artifacts, restarts services, runs migrations, promotes a
  channel, holds deployment credentials, or performs rollback.
- Read-only upstream release discovery with safe defaults for the public Agentic SOC
  repository, Stable `main`, and Testing `Testing`. **Settings → Organization →
  Updates & releases** lets fork operators change the canonical GitHub URL, either
  branch, and the cache interval. The backend performs bounded cached metadata reads;
  the shell can link a newer source version/revision for review, suppresses downgrades,
  and never confuses source availability with the separately verified deployment
  activation control.
- A dedicated operator contract at `docs/analyst/case-manager.md` covering queue
  scope, action authority, confirmations, permissions, audit, and partial failures.
- A compact persisted System / Light / Dark appearance selector, an in-app Docs
  destination with bundled-version guidance, and a current Console UI standard for
  page structure, flat surfaces, navigation, motion/loading, themes, and accessibility.
- A canonical `webui/src/design-system/` boundary with one centered,
  reduced-motion-safe loading grammar, original theme-adaptive source marks for the
  connector catalog, and a JSON-serializable component/token/asset catalog. The
  catalog is future agent/MCP input only; 0.1.2 does not ship an MCP server.
- Additive aggregate-only `GET /api/metrics/agent-improvement` reporting behind
  `metrics:view`: the last seven complete UTC days are compared with the preceding
  28 through weighted analyst-reported agreement, material correction rate, and human
  review turnaround. Identically weighted source/severity cohorts must cover both
  windows; sample sufficiency, bounded-load truncation, evaluable false-negative and
  fixed-horizon reopen guardrails, exclusions, and definitions remain explicit. The
  response returns no synthetic composite, source/case identifiers, raw evidence, or
  model calls and makes no causal learning claim. Agreement and correction are treated
  as one correlated quality domain for headline promotion, actor-label limitations are
  disclosed, and exclusion counters are bounded to the reporting horizon.
- The same report now carries a separate, non-headline outcome layer: confirmed-
  positive rate among outcome-graded cases; recorded usage-ledger cost for case-linked
  model calls; observed agent-terminal versus human-terminal closure elapsed-time
  difference; durable ingested versus after-clustering volume; and applied tuning
  chronology with `causal_claim=false`. It adds true 7-day versus prior-7-day and
  rolling-28-day versus prior-28-day comparisons. A true-positive/raw-alert yield is
  explicitly unavailable because cases and alerts are unlike units, and semantic
  missing-source guidance remains a documented long-term objective. Missing human
  cohorts, undersized samples, or unavailable ledgers remain explicit rather than
  becoming synthetic time, overtime, savings, or improvement claims.
- Shared `ComparisonMetric` and `MetricDefinition` Console primitives now keep
  **Analytics → Agent effectiveness** and Auto-tuning's dedicated **Outcomes**
  workspace aligned. They reuse the established KPI delta grammar and add explicit
  prior/sample/availability context plus keyboard/touch-accessible formula, numerator,
  denominator, eligibility, and caveat disclosure.
- A permission-gated **Intelligence → Playbooks** manager for browsing/opening plain
  Markdown and creating/editing operator-owned procedures. Bundled procedures remain
  protected; mutations are slug/path-contained, size-bounded, atomically reloaded,
  append-only audited, and recommendation-only with deterministic decisions untouched.
- A dedicated **Intelligence → Runbooks** manager for browsing full bundled guidance
  and creating, editing, deleting, or reindexing durable operator Markdown. It uses
  `runbooks:read/manage`, optimistic revisions, protected bundled content, targeted
  full-body RAG projection, explicit stale/failed index state, and append-only audit;
  runbooks remain retrieval knowledge and cannot replace deterministic case policy.
- A redacted **alert → correlation cluster → opened case** explanation on the case
  Threat Context tab. It projects persisted input counts, opaque stable references,
  source breakdown, matched rule/window/grouping/threshold, opened-case status, and
  related cases without returning raw source identifiers or payloads.
- A **Settings → Organization → Data export** workflow that keeps the legacy bounded
  `POST /api/admin/export` contract and adds fresh-auth, resumable
  `/api/admin/export/segment` plus `/cancel`. The Console follows every selected safe
  scope past 5,000 records using numbered response-bounded files, progress, and
  cancellation; Elasticsearch cases/audit/usage use one PIT per scope while weaker
  backends disclose their consistency instead of claiming an exact backup. The
  dedicated `data_export:export` permission defaults to `super_admin` and
  `soc_manager`; strict registry reads and fail-closed audit persistence prevent a
  partial scope from looking complete, every delivered compact segment is audited, while credentials,
  users/sessions, password/MFA material, upstream raw logs, and raw knowledge chunks
  remain excluded.
- A capability-aware **Settings → Organization → Storage & retention** policy:
  desired Hot 180 days, Warm 90 days, then AWS S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval from
  day 270, with deletion always off. Explicit preview/apply can enforce Elasticsearch
  ILM only for append-only audit and usage ledgers when privileges and data tiers are
  present; cases/live metadata remain Hot, PostgreSQL is advisory, SQLite is
  export-only, and connected source retention remains external. Glacier correctly
  stays not configured until an independent checksummed export/restore pipeline exists.
- Microsoft Entra ID / Active Directory is the fifth isolated Demo Mode source,
  exercising synthetic Graph `auditLogs/signIns` and Identity Protection vocabulary
  alongside Splunk, QRadar, Wazuh, and syslog.

### Changed

- The beta patch snapshot was versioned **0.1.2** and continued to bundle the
  existing **0.1** Help Center line. It reached `main` without a published
  `v0.1.2` tag. The later 0.1.3 candidate also remained an unpublished Testing
  snapshot; the 0.1.4 and 0.1.5 publication attempts remained non-installable, while
  0.1.6, 0.1.7, and 0.1.8 published signed artifacts but remained bootstrap-blocked.
  Version 0.1.9 failed later in its constrained release fixture, and 0.1.10 timed
  out during the emulated Web Console build; 0.1.11 is the governed publication
  correction. A version string alone never implies Stable
  provenance or a completed deployment.
- Fresh workspaces now use the bundled OpenAI model ID `gpt-5.6-luna` for every
  completion role, with `reasoning_effort: none` preserving the existing Chat Completions
  latency/tool contract. Embeddings remain on `text-embedding-3-small`; persisted
  role assignments and all alternate providers/models remain available and are
  never rewritten by the default change. The bundled release catalog records
  $0.20/M input, $0.02/M cached input, $0.25/M cache write, and $1.20/M output;
  operators must compare configured catalog values with their provider contract,
  and a discounted ledger rate is applied only to a provider-confirmed tier.
- The shared Console shell and explicitly migrated reference surfaces now use one
  visual grammar: consistent page anatomy, flat telemetry and control bands, compact
  squared controls, restrained section boundaries, responsive tables/tabs, shared
  empty states, and one centered blocking-load treatment. Supported compatibility and
  older routes continue to migrate under the documented UI standard rather than being
  called complete because their surrounding shell changed. Presentation work preserves
  route contracts, deep links, RBAC, APIs, data, and deterministic case decisions.
- Sign-in now uses one minimal, centered identity-first surface instead of a marketing
  split pane: username advances to password, optional demo credentials and SSO remain
  explicit, and System/Light/Dark follows the same persisted theme path as the Console.
  The sparse tile canvas stays behind the opaque form, disappears on narrow screens,
  honors reduced motion, and switches theme atomically. Setup, MFA, enrollment, and
  forced-password modes retain the same practical identity shell, with no synthetic
  audit-status claim or repeated security copy.
- Workspace Chat is now a compact split conversation workspace: a searchable 264px
  desktop history rail becomes a mobile History Sheet, the transcript starts at the
  top of a readable measure, and one status plus one composer remain anchored to the
  active thread. Answer provenance is consolidated under **Evidence & execution**;
  saved-thread restore/error states preserve the workspace, each visited thread keeps
  its own unsent browser draft, focus revalidates history, and follow-scroll yields to
  **Jump to latest** while older evidence is being read. Bounded-history metadata makes
  the 50-conversation/100-message retention boundary explicit. Case Manager chat
  continues to use the same engine while remaining case-scoped and outside personal
  Workspace history. Chats from before durable history were browser-only and cannot be
  recovered.
- The entire first-run wizard is now a wide, responsive Console-style setup
  workspace with four honest stages: **Workspace, Data sources, AI runtime, and
  Review & launch**. Synthetic demo and Live are explicit starting modes; live
  setup may launch with warnings instead of falsely claiming readiness. Provider
  keys remain write-only and auto-save through one guarded navigation path, open
  source drafts require discard confirmation, and the final labels are **Launch
  Agentic SOC** on first run or **Apply changes** on a Settings re-run. Setup-status
  failure now blocks the operational console behind a retryable fail-closed state;
  lost completion responses reconcile against authoritative setup status.

- The Security Command Center now uses one selected-window lifecycle story across
  five primary KPIs, puts Open before Resolved, uses the current open queue for
  Active Risk, limits Latest Cases to four with hover/focus detail, and keeps the
  Noise Reduction and response-timing views in a denser command-center layout.
  It defaults to visibility-aware **LIVE** refresh at a five-second cadence and can
  expand Noise Reduction into a near-fullscreen aggregate inspection view with
  counter-coverage and truncation caveats.
- Noise Reduction retains the established horizontal ribbon and aligned stage rail.
  Its data semantics are now explicit: Auto-cleared and Escalated partition opened
  cases, human closure is an analyst-owned subset of Escalated, optional candidates
  are not presented as a required stage before case creation, and outcome controls
  open the matching selected-window Cases cohort. Counts, percentages, coverage, and
  truncation notices remain authoritative over decorative chart geometry.
- Opening a record from the full-width Cases table now shows a short announced
  handoff and opens that exact case in Case Manager, the canonical detail workspace.
  The desktop queue/detail divider is pointer- and keyboard-resizable, bounded,
  resettable, and persisted locally; compact layouts retain the queue-to-detail back path.
- Case Overview separates the decision brief, signal profile, persisted risk
  factors, source/agent/code provenance, entity context, and attack story. Timeline
  labels the stored score event **Risk Assigned**, reconstructs it from persisted
  factors and current weights while flagging a historical-weight mismatch,
  calls the terminal stage **Decision**, suppresses duplicate Investigation
  verdict/confidence, and pulses only the Case Manager terminal marker.
- The case Take Action menu no longer repeats the visible Timeline and Investigation
  tabs.
- Release documentation now codifies the permanent `Testing` → protected `main`
  promotion path, immutable annotated Stable tags, detailed per-patch release pages,
  and version-matched Help Center aliases. Stable Pages publication is now gated on
  the exact annotated version tag resolving to current `main`, so a branch push cannot
  publish release documentation prematurely.
- GitHub community hygiene now includes a Code of Conduct, structured bug/feature/
  documentation/support issue forms, support routing, a pull-request checklist, and
  generated release-note categories. Repository description and licensing remain
  owner/legal metadata decisions.
- The redundant Automated Scans page has left primary navigation (its route/API remain
  compatible for bookmarked links); Workspace now calls the targeted workflow
  **Entity investigation** and explains its scope → analysis → case lifecycle.
- Settings is now a responsive configuration workspace: a grouped, searchable desktop
  rail becomes a compact searchable Sheet chooser on narrow layouts; each renderer owns
  exactly one active-section heading beneath a quiet location/dirty-status line; and
  flat `SettingsCard`, field, switch, and posture lanes replace nested card chrome.
  One sticky Save/Discard bar retains deep links, RBAC filtering, write-only secrets,
  and partial-update dirty tracking. Blocking loads use the shared centered
  Fluent/Material-style indeterminate progress ring.
- Auto-tuning Operations is rebuilt as a flat task workspace with a continuous
  evidence strip, a rule-grouped Review queue, truthful **Collecting / Within target /
  Needs attention** states, a searchable responsive All monitored rules list, and a
  contextual rule inspector. Attention rows now lead with the exact evidence gate,
  policy gap in percentage points, recommended action, expected operational effect,
  and safety-replay result; supporting statistics no longer compete with the diagnosis.
  The redesign removes wide-table overflow and misleading per-kind Apply affordances:
  one action now reflects the backend's actual rule-scoped processing contract while
  unrelated rules remain usable. **Eligible after replay** replaces misleading
  **Safe** copy because processing always recomputes the evidence and safeguards.
- Workspace's targeted flow is consistently labelled **Entity investigation** and
  explains the telemetry → correlation → saved-case outcome.
- Auto-tuning is divided into three focused workspaces: **Operations** for rule health
  and proposals, permission-gated **Outcomes** for controlled aggregate comparison,
  and **Policy & history**, with editable policy before audit chronology. The
  Outcomes workspace shows one operator-selected graph at a time, preserves the exact
  complete-UTC windows, comparable samples, exclusions, truncation, and distinct
  safety-guardrail states from the Agent Effectiveness contract, and keeps change
  chronology explicitly non-causal. Loading or evidence failure remains isolated from
  tuning controls, while the full-evidence action opens the canonical Analytics view.
- Under-sampled tuning rules are no longer presented as healthy, and multiple
  recommendations for one rule are no longer rendered as independently actionable
  when the backend processes them together.
- The false-positive auto-close policy note is shown only for a false-positive/benign
  case where it can still explain an active or manual outcome. True-positive and
  needs-human cases no longer inherit the irrelevant sentence, and an already
  AI-auto-closed false positive no longer displays the contradictory disabled-policy
  note. The embedded Case Manager outcome also drops its redundant top divider.
- Compatible official OpenAI case/alert calls now prefer live Flex processing by
  default, independently of the opt-in asynchronous Batch event funnel. Unsupported
  endpoints/models stay standard; eligible Flex capacity failures can retry at
  standard service, and the single usage row records and prices only the tier actually
  returned.
- **Agentic SOC** is now the operator-facing product name. The `TLSOC` compatibility
  namespace remains unchanged for existing environment variables, containers/images,
  indices, cookies/storage, headers, entry points, packages, and wire/API identifiers.
- The canonical Console build now generates the version-matched same-origin Help
  Center before typecheck/Vite. Installed documentation is authoritative for that
  build; public Stable and Development remain explicitly separate secondary views.

### Fixed

- Auto-tuning now normalizes rule identifiers before evidence aggregation,
  recommendation, proposal, ledger, and rollback work, preventing trailing source
  whitespace from repeating the same canonical `1 -> 2` change. Automatic application
  requires explicit opt-in plus shadow evaluation; scheduler, manual, approval, and
  rollback paths use strict idempotent ledger persistence with exact preference
  compensation if that persistence fails.
- Final UI-standard hardening removed nested table-row activation, restored named
  row actions and visible chat-composer focus, protected dirty Settings drafts during
  Console navigation and page exit, corrected Scans focus/heading semantics, and
  normalized shared overlays to dynamic viewport units without changing route, API,
  RBAC, or case-decision contracts.
- Branding now clears stale inline tokens before reapplication, keeps semantic
  severity/status/verdict axes system-owned, measures semantic text on the actual
  translucent wash, and derives a contrast-safe primary foreground consistently in
  the backend, editor preview, and browser. Legacy hex color documents normalize at
  the DOM boundary, including exact crossover colors, while saved display-font keys
  round-trip across current and legacy full-stack values without switching the
  operator's chosen appearance.
- Workspace Chat no longer presents a failed history read as an empty account or a
  failed history write as a saved conversation. Explicit unavailable/non-queryable
  source scope now returns `chat_source_unavailable` instead of silently querying
  Primary, and saved turns expose the source/model that actually executed them.
- Workspace history now uses one hashed StateStore partition per normalized user rather
  than rewriting a shared all-user document. Existing shared-history deployments are
  read and lazily migrated through the compatibility path, with no reset required.
- Opening **Settings → Branding** no longer replaces an operator's explicit Light or
  Dark appearance with the organization's default theme. The org-default selector now
  edits branding configuration only; explicit personal appearance remains authoritative,
  while System users adopt a newly saved organization default as intended.

### Verification

- Latest fully recorded baseline: **2,073 backend tests** and **1,732 web tests across 268 files**;
  release/version, generated-contract, Compose, lint/design, build, and strict-docs
  checks remain part of promotion acceptance.
- Focused Case Manager bulk-action and release-badge coverage is **21/21** green.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-17 — Auth-lockout hardening

Fixes a total, silent authentication lockout: a transient empty read from the
`UserStore` (its loader swallows read errors and degrades to `[]`) used to flow through
`AppState.refresh_users` → `AuthService.set_users([])`, collapsing the in-memory auth
view to the env base layer alone. On an OOBE-only deployment (no env-seeded admin) that
evicted every persisted account, so every login returned 401 despite an intact,
verifiable password hash — until the process restarted. Backend-only; `decide()` (#3)
untouched.

### Fixed

- `AppState.refresh_users` now treats an empty `users.list()` as a **failed read** and
  keeps the current auth view, unless the raising `UserStore.has_any()` probe
  authoritatively confirms zero users. A transient empty read can no longer evict
  accounts.
- `AuthService.set_users` gained an `allow_empty` guard: an empty update that would drop
  previously-known **stored** accounts is refused (warn + keep the view) unless the
  caller passes an authoritative empty-store signal — a second, independent layer of
  protection.
- `AppState.apply_secrets` now re-folds the persisted user store into the auth view
  after a credential-change `_wire()` rebuild, so an ES-credential change no longer locks
  stored/OOBE accounts out until the next user mutation or restart.
- Preference writes are serialized under a new `AppState._prefs_lock`; a new
  `mutate_prefs(mutate)` performs the read-modify-write **inside** the lock. The source
  routes (`POST/DELETE /api/sources`, `POST /api/sources/{id}/secrets`) use it, so a
  source rename reads the freshest prefs and is no longer clobbered by a same-path
  concurrent write (the observed "rename did not persist"). (Fully closing the
  cross-writer prefs lost-update still needs config-store CAS — tracked separately.)

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-15 — Backend deep-audit hardening

A multi-agent deep audit of the backend (24 subsystem auditors over ~200 files /
63k LOC, every finding adversarially re-verified against the source) produced **47
verified findings** (0 critical, 10 high, 24 medium, 13 low). All 47 were fixed, each
as its own focused commit with a regression test, on `Testing` (local, not tagged or
pushed). Non-negotiable **#3** was verified clean — `engine/case_manager.py::decide()`
is untouched and no LLM/playbook path can drive close/escalate.

### Security

- The `#9` untrusted-fence seam no longer lets an attacker-set `source=`/`tool=`
  provenance label (e.g. a RAG document's `source`) escape the fence — prompt-injection
  (OWASP LLM01) closed; RAG import sanitises the source at write time.
- Authorization added to state-changing / LLM-billing routes that were authN-only:
  `POST /setup/secrets` + `/setup/complete` (settings:manage), `/cases/{id}/investigate`
  + `/reinvestigate` and `/api/investigate` (cases:reinvestigate), `/api/overview` +
  `/api/chat` (cases:read); case-thread edit/delete is now author-or-moderator scoped.
- OIDC/SSO: the `state` token is bound to the initiating browser (HttpOnly cookie),
  account linking requires a **verified** email and never links onto a local-credential
  account by email alone (SSO takeover / login-CSRF fixed).
- Enrichment providers no longer leak an API key (Shodan/Pulsedive `?key=`) into error
  messages / logs / the UI. JWT decode raises `TokenError` (not a 500) on non-ASCII
  segments. `POST /api/ingest/{source}` caps the request body (413) before buffering.

### Fixed

- **Concurrency:** SessionStore / UserStore / ProposalStore route every mutation through
  the CAS `kv_mutate` (per-store lock + `_rev`), and `KVStore.put_if` gains a real atomic
  compare-and-set in the SQL backend (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) — lost updates (incl. a
  silently-dropped session revocation) closed. `notify()` merges `notifications_sent`
  onto the fresh case; the notification dedup key is recorded only after a successful send.
- **Ingestion durability:** object-store & Kinesis receiver cursors persist via
  `CursorStore`; the non-PIT offset drain caps at `max_result_window` (no more permanent
  stall); the poller only handles clusters with a new event this tick (no duplicate
  cases); one concurrency-safe per-tick budget now caps the complete cross-source
  fan-out while durable deferred candidates drain without starvation, and the drain
  scans only OPEN cases; MQTT acks only after a confirmed ingest; syslog-UDP ingest
  errors are surfaced. Syslog TLS now creates a real TLS 1.2+ listener from mounted
  key/certificate material, optionally verifies client certificates, and fails closed.
- **Correctness / cost:** MTTA/SLA count only human acknowledgments (not autopilot
  system escalations); stringified-epoch and uppercase-`Z` timestamps parse to the right
  instant; ModSec sub-rules match the real `rule.id`; the OpenAI batch parser subtracts
  cached tokens (no double-billing); `score_to_severity_id` is scale-aware; campaigns
  treat MITRE as an advisory overlay (no over-clustering); the tuner guards
  `severity_floor` per window and records the ledger/audit only after a confirmed write;
  the investigator and per-event overview receive full evidence (`fence_block`, no
  600-char truncation).
- **Resource bounds / observability:** the SSE history topics, in-memory cache fallback,
  rate-limit bucket map, per-signature lock registry, and demo mock-provider call ring
  are all bounded; SSE no longer duplicates frames on reconnect or leaves zombie
  connections after eviction; `SqlUsageRepository.summary` window-bounds in SQL (off the
  budget-gate hot path); the SQL audit scan pages so JSON-only filters don't under-return;
  `ES count()` surfaces live faults instead of masking them as `0`.

### Fixed — Noise-Reduction funnel (2026-07-16, backend-only)

- The durable `NoiseCounterStore` (and the anomaly `BaselineStore`) are now cleared on a
  **source delete** (`DELETE /api/sources/{id}`) and on a **cases / factory reset**
  (`engine/reset.py`), so `GET /api/metrics/noise-reduction` no longer over-reports
  inbound volume from a removed source or a purged period. Both are advisory counters —
  never read by `decide()` (#3) and no `cluster_signature` recompute (#4); the clears are
  fail-open and can never fail the delete/reset.
- The funnel's terminal **Escalated** node now carries every case the agent did not
  auto-clear: `build_noise_reduction` folds the previously-invisible `needs_human` bucket
  and the `true_positive` residual into the `escalated` stage (total + per-severity bands,
  `== cases − auto_cleared`), so the visible outcomes account for every windowed case. The
  standalone `needs_human` stage and the reduction headline are unchanged, and the funnel
  diagram, node set, and API shape are byte-identical (no new node, no query params).

### Release status

- Local gates green (2026-07-14/15): **1942 backend `pytest`** passed (0 failures; +55
  regression tests over the 1887 baseline), **1349 web `vitest` / 240 files**, `npm run
  build` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors. Working tree clean; **no co-author trailer** on
  any of the 48 commits; **not pushed**.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-19 — 0.1.0 Testing release foundation

This Version 0.1 foundation is implemented on `Testing` but **not yet tagged or
promoted to the Stable `main` branch**.
It establishes one canonical SemVer identity, truthful runtime/readiness checks,
source-safe ingest/investigation boundaries, a full connector image, CI release
gates, and a GitHub Pages documentation site. Remaining publication blockers are
kept explicit in `docs/releases/known-limitations.md`.

### Added

- Root `VERSION` synchronized across Python, FastAPI/OpenAPI, npm, Compose image
  tags, OCI labels, and public documentation, enforced by `scripts/check_version.py`.
- Liveness, persistence-write readiness, and build-info endpoints.
- MkDocs Material public docs, strict GitHub Pages builds, release-channel policy,
  connector support matrix, architecture, and known-limitations register.
- Default `full` backend image with all advertised connector clients, plus an
  explicit smaller `core` target; non-root runtime and wheel-content smoke tests.
- A bounded four-source live demo (Splunk HEC, QRadar LEEF/offenses, Wazuh JSON,
  RFC 5424/3164), guaranteed and on-demand correlated incidents via
  `POST /api/demo/incident`, per-source health/live-tail telemetry, and a forced
  `$0` mock provider inside the isolated demo stack.

### Fixed

- Push event IDs are deterministic and source-scoped; per-source field mappings now
  apply consistently to webhook, common, and object-store paths.
- Failed persistence is no longer acknowledged as successful: HTTP returns 503,
  Kafka commits only after processing, and S3 notification work is retained.
- Push threshold correlation spans successive callbacks; receiver tasks restart with
  bounded backoff after a retryable processing failure.
- Pull pagination uses PIT + `search_after`, stable tie-breaking, an overlap ledger,
  and source-index-qualified identities; rollover `_id` collisions remain distinct.
- Source-scoped case signatures no longer merge independent systems and migrate an
  open legacy signature in place. Re-investigation is pinned to the stored case and
  originating query source; push-only sources cannot fall back to global Elastic.
- Cap-deferred candidates use the durable case store as a quiet-tick drain queue.
- State readiness now proves write permission instead of reporting connectivity only.
- The daily budget defaults to a hard preflight block at the configured ceiling;
  warning-only behavior is an explicit operator opt-in.

### Release status

- Local candidate gates passed on 2026-07-11: **1887 backend tests**, **1349 web
  tests / 240 files**, lint with 0 errors, all five design gates, generated API
  contract drift, production build, wheel/package smoke tests, canonical version,
  agnostic Compose configuration, and strict MkDocs build. No public release should
  be cut until the license and remaining blockers in the public limitation register
  are resolved or deliberately reclassified.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-09 — Round 10: Autopilot & Comprehensive Ingestion + motion.dev

A **behavior-changing** round — **the suite now reads and reasons over everything, and
self-tunes, BY DEFAULT.** Built research (vendor + industry-standards) → code (5
batches) → adversarial verify → fix → re-verify; the verify pass found **5 major + 6
minor** findings, all fixed and re-verified before sign-off. Non-negotiables hold
throughout: `case_manager.decide()` stays the sole close/escalate authority and is
**byte-identical**; `engine/risk.py` and `engine/signatures.py` are **untouched** — the
new comprehensive-ingestion risk gate only *reads* `compute_risk()` to route a
candidate to investigation, it never changes scoring or the decision itself (#3). No
`docs/research/` folder this round (efficiency-first) — see `Journal.md`'s Round-10
entry. Developed directly on `Testing` and subsequently committed.

### Changed — comprehensive ingestion is now the default
- `background_scan_enabled` defaults to **TRUE**: every event from every source is now
  correlated, risk-scored (0–100), and made visible — nothing is silently dropped
  from view.
- EVENTS-role clusters auto-forward to the strong-LLM investigation through a new
  **deterministic risk gate**: `risk_score >= auto_investigate_risk_floor` (default
  **70**). Below-floor clusters stay **$0 candidates** — visible, never dropped (#4).
- ALERTS-role feeds **bypass the gate entirely** and correlate in `mode=EVERY`, so
  every alert becomes exactly one case (same-signature bursts coalesce onto the one
  open case).
- A per-source, per-tick cap — `caps.max_auto_investigations_per_tick` (default
  **25**) — bounds concurrent LLM spend; cap-deferred candidates **drain** to
  investigation on a later tick once headroom frees, never lost.
- Investigations run **sequentially**; the push ingestion path is symmetric with pull;
  the daily budget (below) is the **global** spend bound across all sources.

### Added — autopilot smart defaults
- **Default-ON, $0 / #3-safe:** threshold tuning (`shadow_eval` forced on),
  campaigns, cross-source correlation, SLA policy, priority matrix, realtime SSE, the
  threshold-automation engine (seeded with an empty rule set), and baseline (the
  producer + a new silent-source detector).
- **Still opt-in:** batch LLM processing, warning-only budget mode,
  `run_playbook`/`notify` default automation rules, and baseline-drives-investigation.
- New **`Preferences.autopilot_profile`** dial — `conservative` / `balanced` (default)
  / `aggressive` — scales `(risk_floor, daily_usd, cap)` together: conservative
  **90 / $5 / 10**, balanced **70 / $10 / 25**, aggressive **40 / $50 / 100**.

### Added — default budget backstop
- `BudgetConfig` now defaults **enabled**, `daily_usd=$10`, `soft_warn_pct=0.80`,
  `on_exceed="block"`. An over-budget day routes candidates to **NEEDS_HUMAN** — it
  **never** auto-closes (#3) — so "read everything by default" cannot become "spend
  everything."

### Changed — migration: auto-adopt + one-time banner
- A stored pre-overhaul config **auto-adopts** the new ON defaults behind a new
  `autopilot_config_version` marker and sets `show_autopilot_banner=True`; any
  explicit opt-out an operator made **before** upgrading is preserved verbatim. The
  `AutomationNudge` card is **inverted** — from "turn automation on" to an "autopilot
  is ON — here's what it's doing / turn it off" reassurance card. Migrated tenants
  get the tuner's `shadow_eval` force-enabled the same as fresh ones.

### Added — coverage observability
- Per-source **last-poll snapshot** — `last_poll_at` / `last_poll_ok` /
  `last_poll_error` / `events_per_min` / `silent` — additive fields on
  `GET /api/sources/health`; a source whose feeds **all** raise now correctly reports
  `ok=False` (multi-feed failure detection).
- `AuditDoc.source_id` (+ the ES `AUDIT_MAPPING` keyword field) enables
  `GET /api/audit?source_id=`; a new per-source noise dimension.
- New **`GET /api/sources/coverage`** rollup — `{sources_total, sources_enabled,
  sources_silent, events_per_min, alerts_triaged_24h, worst_last_event_seconds}`.
- webui: a Sources coverage banner + server-truth per-row status, an Overview
  coverage tile, and an honest "awaiting / candidate" stage in the Noise-Reduction
  funnel (below-floor candidates are no longer invisible).

### Added — motion.dev (lazy)
- **ONE new runtime dependency: `motion` 12.42.2** (`framer-motion` was removed in
  Round 5). Loaded behind `LazyMotion` + `m` + `domAnimation` + `MotionConfig
  reducedMotion="user"`, landing in a **LAZY ~83.85 kB chunk** — the entry chunk
  stays **281.44 kB** and never modulepreloads it.
- Animates route/page transitions, the CaseDetail tab-enter, the Cases bulk-bar exit
  + row reflow, the NavSidebar rail, and dashboard KPI count-ups (`AnimatedNumber`
  dynamic-imported into `KpiTile` so it too stays lazy). Reduced-motion is honored
  throughout (count-ups snap instead of animating).

### Standards cited (industry-grounded defaults)
- Risk floor **70** ≈ Elastic entity-risk "High" band start (cross-vendor High
  midpoint ~70). Tuner: `min_samples=30`, Wilson **0.95** lower-bound, modified-z
  **3.5**, bounded **±1** nudge, `target_fp_rate=0.10`. Baseline warm-up **14d**
  (Sentinel UEBA precedent) / modified-z **3.5**. Anomaly-alert threshold **75**
  (Elastic ML precedent). `daily_usd=$10` ≈ a coffee budget, roughly **10×** below
  typical AI-SOC entry pricing.

### Fixed — adversarial verification pass
- The verify pass over the 5 code batches found **5 major + 6 minor** findings; all
  11 were fixed and the fix was re-verified before sign-off.

### Dependencies
- **Added** `motion` **12.42.2** (runtime, LAZY-loaded — see above). **Zero** other
  new deps, backend or webui.

### Verification (2026-07-09)
- Backend **1796 pytest** green (was 1708); webui `tsc + vite build` clean, **entry
  chunk 281.44 kB** (motion lazy-chunk 83.85 kB, never modulepreloaded); **1332
  Vitest** specs / 239 files green (was 1268 / 229); eslint **0 errors** (3 benign
  warnings); `engine/case_manager.py` `decide()` **byte-identical**; `engine/risk.py` /
  `engine/signatures.py` **untouched**; **zero new deps except the deliberate lazy
  `motion`**. Developed and committed on `Testing`.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-06 — Round 9c: dashboard rebuilt from scratch, real MTTD + first-response MTTR, cleaner Cases

A third follow-up round on user feedback, referencing Prisma Cloud "Cloud Security
Operations Dashboard" and Cortex XSIAM screenshots for visual language. A BE-metrics-
contract agent, a dashboard agent, and a Cases agent worked disjoint files, followed by
a review → adversarial-verify validation workflow and a fix pass (commits `20118a7` →
`ceba59d` → `c4d1bb6` → `2cc94c5`). Shipped: real **Mean Time To Detect**
(`Case.first_seen_millis`, stamped at case-creation from the originating cluster, feeds
`lifecycle_intervals.mttd_minutes`, skipping backdated negatives) and **Mean Time To
Respond as the first HUMAN response** — the acknowledge/ACK clock (assigning,
investigating, escalating, or putting a case on hold all count), deliberately **not**
the dwell-to-resolution clock, which the validation pass caught crediting an AI
auto-close as a "human response"; a burndown chart (opened-vs-resolved per day) and a
per-day timing trend (MTTD/respond/resolve, null-gapped rather than fabricating zeros);
the **Overview rebuilt Prisma-style** (a 5-tile KPI micro-strip → a hero row of Active
Risk Index + a resolved-cases donut + an open-cases donut, each with a real
previous-window trend delta → the full-width Noise-Suppression ribbon, now flowing
`ingested → clustered → cases → auto_cleared → escalated → closed` with a new terminal
**"closed by human"** stage → a burndown/timing/top-open-cases row, with secondary
detail folded into a shallow "Deeper analytics"); and a cleaner **Cases** list (a
6-tile incident-summary strip, a calm 2-tier toolbar, a monogram Assignee column). All
of it is advisory/read-time — `decide()` never reads the new timing fields (#3). The
validation pass fixed 5 findings: the Respond-clock honesty bug above; a reopened-case
guard so a stale terminal `status_history` entry on a since-reopened case can't corrupt
burndown/MTTR/resolve-trend; the Noise ribbon's overlapping terminal outcomes
(auto-cleared/escalated/closed can co-occur, so shares summed past 100%) now normalized
so the ribbon tiles the cases node exactly; and two WCAG-AA contrast fixes (the
Overview SLA chip + autonomy tiles, and the Cases "Needs human" tile's tone). Additive;
`decide()` **byte-identical**; **zero new runtime deps**. Green: **1708 pytest / 1268
Vitest (229 files) / build clean (entry 279.32 kB, gzip 82.55 kB) / lint 0 errors (3
warnings)** / all 5 design gates pass. Developed on `claude/ui-ux-improvements-7nq5be`
(off `Testing` `1ab98f2`), merged into `Testing` via **PR #27** (`559ce88`, current
HEAD). See `Journal.md:1474-1482` — Rounds 9/9b/9c have no `docs/research/` folder
(done efficiency-first, without the research-brief fan-out).

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-05 — Round 9b: dashboard reimagine, hover-to-expand sidebar, CaseDetail Timeline/Investigation split

A second follow-up round on user feedback to Round 9, run efficiency-first (3 focused
disjoint-file agents, no research fan-out). Shipped (commits `71153f2` → `283aa59` →
`b0d8747`): a **hover-to-expand sidebar** — the collapsed rail hover/focus-expands into
a floating drawer overlay without reflowing the page (the rail keeps its 64px
footprint); the Noise-Reduction widget **reverted from Round 9's flat stage-bars back
to a flow ribbon** (per user preference — prettier, with per-stage hover detail:
count/%/meaning/severity mini-breakdown) and the "LLM Spend" tagline removed; the
Overview reorganized into a dense multi-zone grid (KPIs → response timing [MTTA/MTTR/
Dwell from posture p50, MTTD honestly shown "n/a" — not yet fabricated] → noise →
attention-queue + severity + outcome-donut → top lists) with only a shallow "Deeper
analytics" fold; and **CaseDetail** redesigned — Timeline is now "what happened" only
(a new `TimelinePanel`), a separate Investigation tab holds the AI assessment + pinned
`DecisionCard` + full ReAct trace, the case Sheet widened to
`max-w-[min(98vw,1400px)]`, an "Open in new tab" button (wired `router.optsFromHash()`
to parse `caseId` so a fresh tab boots straight into the case), and the Overview redone
as a Decision-Brief hero → SOURCE SAYS/AGENT FOUND/CODE DECIDED provenance row →
primary-entity/attack-story/relationship row → evidence-checklist + reproduce →
Related/Provenance collapsibles. No backend change this round. Additive; `decide()`
**byte-identical**; **zero new deps**. Green: **webui 1264 Vitest (228 files) / build
clean (entry 279.3 kB) / lint 0 errors**; backend pytest unaffected (unchanged from
Round 9's 1696). Developed on `claude/ui-ux-improvements-7nq5be`, merged into `Testing`
via **PR #26** (`749bce6`). See `Journal.md:1467-1472`.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-05 — Round 9: 11-ask UI/UX overhaul + local LiteLLM model provider

An 11-ask UI/UX overhaul on a new branch `claude/ui-ux-improvements-7nq5be` (created
off `Testing` HEAD `1ab98f2`), built via a 12-agent research + codebase-mapping fan-out
(QRadar/Splunk ES/Sentinel/Elastic/Chronicle/XSIAM dashboard patterns + Prophet/
Dropzone + LiteLLM/vLLM/Ollama/OpenWebUI/Jan + login/wizard/dataviz UX) → design briefs
→ parallel implementation agents on disjoint files → 3 full test passes → a 4-agent
adversarial validation → a fix pass (commits `709e758` → `d13b6f0` → `1adc5ce` →
`26c4266`). Shipped: removed the redundant in-page tab strips that duplicated the left
nav (Overview `Dashboard|Standup`, Workspace `Chat|Investigate`, Intelligence
`Knowledge|Memory|Playbooks` — each host now renders its active sub-view via the
existing `tab` route option, no registry change); **Overview** — LLM Spend off the
hero (replaced by 5 alert/case KPIs; spend demoted to a "Deeper analytics" tripwire), a
bigger notched Active Risk Index card, and tightened rhythm to fill the wide screen;
**Noise-Reduction redesigned** — the Round-8 Sankey ribbon (wrong shape for a linear
reduction) replaced with clean horizontal aligned stage bars plus a part-to-whole
disposition row (kept `deriveFunnel()`/testids/`onStageClick`); **Sources** rebuilt
from a card list into a QRadar-style "Log Source Management" `DataTable` (search/
filter/"+ New Log Source"/columns-gear/bulk-select/inline Enabled switch/Status dot/
Last Event via a new `api.sourcesHealth()` over the existing `GET /api/sources/
health`); **CaseDetail** — the Investigation tab renamed **Timeline** (a what-happened
narrative plus a collapsible full ReAct trace) and Overview split into "Reported by
source" vs. "Our assessment" provenance sections with a disagreement delta and the
pinned deterministic `DecisionCard` as trust anchor; **Login**/**Wizard** polish
(top-aligned login card, SSO folded into the paint gate, a faithful non-clipping
branding preview, a pre-paint theme stamp; the Wizard dropped marketing cards and a
double hero for a light numbered stepper); and a new **local/self-hosted LiteLLM
(OpenAI-compatible) model provider** — reuses the existing `openai_compatible` gateway
path with a zero-migration custom-models KV store, `POST/DELETE /api/llm/models/
custom`, a non-metered `POST /api/llm/providers/test` reachability probe, $0 pricing,
and an optional `litellm_api_key` secret (env `LITELLM_API_KEY`, or omitted for a
no-auth local endpoint) — all surfaced through a new "Add local model" UI dialog
(base_url + model id + optional key + "Fetch models"). The validation pass also fixed
a **pre-existing
bug**: the shared `POST /api/sources` was rebuilt from a payload that lacked
`configured_secrets`/`created_at`, so every enable/disable toggle, bulk action, or
make-primary call silently wiped a source's secret-name list and reset its creation
date — now both fields carry forward, with a regression test. Additive; `decide()`
**byte-identical**; ledger one-write-per-call (#6) preserved; attacker-influenceable
values fenced/plain (#9); **zero new runtime deps**. Green: **1696 pytest / 1252

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-05 — Round 8: UI cleanup + glitch fixes (from user feedback)

A follow-up polish round on `feature/round7-ui-overhaul` (commits `58745fa`, `f56f812`)
driven by user screenshots. Process: opus plan fleet → **sonnet-only** research fleet →
Wave A (10 opus agents, disjoint files) → Wave B (Overview integration) → 10-agent
adversarial QA (**0 findings**). Shipped: the **Active Risk Index** back in its own card
top-right with the glitchy notch dropped; the **Cases** sticky-header glitch fixed
(double-nested-overflow root cause → non-sticky header + uniform rows); the **Noise
Reduction** funnel redesigned as a **horizontal QRadar-style Sankey ribbon** (reuses
`deriveFunnel()` + the `/api/metrics/noise-reduction` contract unchanged); the **Security
Command Center** header de-carded to a plain big title (Sources-style) with an inverted-
pyramid "Deeper analytics" collapse; **CaseDetail** Overview/Threat tabs deduped and the
**Chat** tab rebuilt on the shared `ChatPanel` (−~150 lines); **Collaboration** tidied;
app-wide **PageHeader** title bump + a 12-page spacing sweep; and **reinvestigate** fixed to
rebuild from a case's stored evidence when the log window has aged out. Additive; `decide()`
**byte-identical**; ZERO new deps. Green: **pytest ✓ / Vitest 1238 / lint 0 errors / build ✓**.
See `docs/research/2026-07-round8/IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-05 — Round 7: Security Command Center overhaul + Noise-Reduction funnel

A UI/UX + product round (12 user changes + 1 feature) on `feature/round7-ui-overhaul`
(commits `850600f` → `1b9ac90` → `e40f0bc` → `7355a9a`). Built by a ~130-agent pipeline
(document → plan → verify → UX research → validate → implement in 3 waves → adversarial QA →
fixes). Headlines: Overview reborn as the **Security Command Center** (Active Risk Index with
a `(?)` explainer, honest **MTTA/MTTR/Dwell** tiles, live-delta KPIs, Top-Contributors); a
durable-counter **"Noise Reduction"** alerts→cases funnel (`GET /api/metrics/noise-reduction`);
**Cases** severity-column bug fixed (one source-asserted Severity + a `source|ai|code`
**provenance** tag); **CaseDetail** retold as a clean story (8 tabs → 5: facts → AI assessment
→ pinned deterministic `DecisionCard`); feedback folded into the close dialog; an **Auto-closed
by AI** badge; and a real motion system (count-up/reveal). Additive; `decide()` **byte-identical**;
zero new runtime deps. The final adversarial QA caught + fixed 8 real bugs (incl. two
funnel-correctness bugs the green tests had masked). See `docs/research/2026-07-round7/`.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-02 — Round 6: fleet glitch-hunt + integration polish (464 adversarially-verified findings fixed)

A sixth round driven by a ~500-agent Opus fleet: every webui source file audited
(155 units incl. 12 thematic deep-dives + 4 API-contract audits), every finding
adversarially verified (466 claimed -> 464 confirmed -> 423 fixed, 47 refuted at
verify/fix time), fixes applied in 30 conflict-free exclusively-owned batches +
a handoff/closer wave. Flagship: the custom-dashboard view-mode stacking bug
(pure `packWidgets` + curated per-role default layouts), PageContainer as the ONE
width authority across all pages, CaseDetail PATCH 405s, the rules version ledger
made real (rollback live), anomaly-rule saves persisted, SecretField unification
(+ per-source connector secrets no longer dropped), honest KPI deltas, WCAG-AA
contrast in both themes, and the new beginner `AutomationNudge` (one-click
recommended automation; #3-safe). Additive wire changes only; `decide()`
byte-identical. Green: **1613 pytest / 1051 Vitest (199 files) / lint 0 errors /
entry 281.6 kB / zero new deps**. See `docs/research/2026-07-round6/IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-02 — Round 5: UI/UX overhaul (cohesive color system + ONE shadcn/Radix design standard), Settings declutter, denser wide dashboard + compact hero, rules customization, custom dashboards, loose coupling, a11y + adversarial audit

A fifth multi-wave round — **"UI/UX overhaul + rules customization + custom dashboards +
loose coupling"** — delivering **9 goals (G1–G9)** plus a **16-dimension adversarial audit**
across **12 commits** (`5ab7c05`…`05552c7`). The round is overwhelmingly a **webui**
overhaul with a **surgical, path-byte-identical** backend surface for rules, dashboards, and a
zero-bill decision-preview. Non-negotiables hold throughout — **`case_manager.decide()` is
BYTE-IDENTICAL** vs the pre-Round-5 baseline `27f0983` (CI diff guard; G6's Test/Preview uses a
NEW read-only wrapper over the pure `decide()` and NEVER re-implements it, NEVER bills the LLM);
**#6** stays one ledger write per real LLM call (no preview/what-if/dashboard/widget path calls
the model — `POST /api/triage/preview-decision` asserts zero `UsageDoc` writes); **#2** (append-
only audit on every rule create/edit/enable/disable/rollback + auto-close change), **#9**
(untrusted → plain text / SVG `<text>` / code block on every new rule/widget/dashboard/view
name + value), and **#10** (secrets = booleans via the new `SecretField`) held on every new
surface; **`PUT /api/settings` stays a deep-MERGE** (round-trip test proves no sibling block is
wiped by any new section) and **all API paths are byte-identical** across the router
decomposition. The webui shed a runtime dep on net (**removed `framer-motion`**, added
**`react-grid-layout`** loaded LAZILY only in dashboard edit-mode); the backend adds **zero new
runtime deps**. The backend offline suite grew **1461 → 1601 tests green**; the webui `tsc +
vite build` is GREEN (entry chunk **537 kB → 264 kB** with `React.lazy` code-splitting restored)
with the Vitest harness expanded **273 → 625 specs** (eslint clean — 0 errors, 4 warnings; the
`jsx-a11y` findings driven **48 → 0**). New here? See [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) and
`docs/research/2026-07-round5/` (`PROPOSAL.md` + `DESIGN_STANDARD.md` [the canonical spec] +
the `understand/` maps + `RESEARCH_*.md` + `IMPLEMENTATION.md` + `AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`). Developed
on the `Testing` branch.

### Added — G1: cohesive color & type system (`0e99c76`)
- A single **Radix slate + blue** foundation with **3 orthogonal semantic axes** — severity /
  status / verdict — each split into `token` / `-foreground` / `-text` triples with **MEASURED
  WCAG-AA contrast in both light and dark themes**; **Okabe-Ito** colour-blind-safe chart ramps
  + a viridis sequential scale; self-hosted **Inter** (variable) + **JetBrains Mono** typefaces.
- The token authority is `label → token`: a domain label (a severity/status/verdict) resolves
  to its token, and components consume the token — never a raw hex.

### Added — G2: ONE consistent design standard (`9854c36`, `3e447da`)
- **shadcn/Radix/Tailwind** enforced end-to-end: shared low-level primitives + **ONE card
  grammar** + the `label → token` authority, adopted across the pages by a **codemod** so every
  surface speaks the same visual language. ~15 new shared components/primitives landed:
  `Field` · `SegmentedControl` · `ConfirmDialog` · `NumberField` · `LabeledSlider` ·
  `SecretField` · `TagInput` · `IconButton` · `PageContainer` · `TimeRangePicker` ·
  `DashboardGroup` · `collapsible` · `typography`, plus the split-out CaseDetail parts.
- **CaseDetail god-file split** — `4210 → 1529` LOC (extracted into focused subcomponents; no
  behaviour or contract change; the unified Close-with-disposition still posts the existing
  close → `decide()`, #3).

### Changed — G3: Settings decluttered (`7c86706`)
- The **2673-line Settings god-file** became a **data-driven registry + `pages/settings/*`
  section files** — `575` LOC of shell over per-section modules; **6 → 5** nav groups with
  **Security promoted to a top-level group**; **≤2 nesting levels**; **33 redirect tests**
  preserving every deep link (`#/settings?s=<id>`, the standalone `#/users`/`#/security`, the
  `detection-correlation` / `advanced-suppression` / `tuning-policy` anchors). `PUT /api/settings`
  deep-MERGE intact (each section sends only its changed keys).

### Changed — G4/G5: denser wide dashboard + compact hero (`f50e0b2`)
- **G4** — the dashboard uses more real-estate: a `PageContainer` wide/fluid mode killed the
  `max-w-[1400px]` cap and moved to a **three-zone layout**.
- **G5** — the **compact hero**: the ~176px `HeroPanel` merged into a **~52px `PageHeader`**.
- **KpiTile** delta rendering corrected to key off the delta's sign (bug).

### Added — G6: rules customization (`b661bc8`)
- A **Detection & Rules** home spanning **3 rule tiers** — detection-match / threshold ·
  anomaly / baseline · case-automation — over a **polymorphic editor** with a **flat condition
  builder**. A **Test / Preview vs. recent data** panel that **NEVER calls `decide()`** and
  **NEVER bills the LLM** (backed by the new read-only `POST /api/triage/preview-decision`
  wrapper over the pure `decide()`); a **version ledger + rollback** (`stores/rule_versions.py`);
  threshold `NumberField` / `LabeledSlider`; asset / SLA / priority / suppression editors.
- Backend `api/routes_rules.py` + `stores/rule_versions.py`; new webui `soc/rules/*`.

### Added — G7: custom dashboards (`830e836`)
- A **widget registry reusing the existing tiles/charts**, a **per-user drag/resize grid**
  (`react-grid-layout`, loaded **LAZILY** only in edit-mode), a **zero-migration `DashboardStore`**
  (`stores/dashboards.py`, KV-doc, no new index/table), **per-role defaults + clone-to-customize**.
- `UserPrefs.dashboards` + `CustomizationConfig.default_dashboards`; backend
  `api/routes_dashboards.py`; new webui `soc/dashboard/*` + `pages/Dashboards.tsx`.

### Changed — G8: loose coupling (`d3801f9`)
- A single **`FEATURES[]` registry** (`soc/registry.ts`) now derives **nav + routes + command
  palette** from one source; `useNavigate()` replaces the `onNavigate` prop-drill; **`React.lazy`
  code-splitting restored** (entry bundle **537 → 264 kB**). `routes.py` **decomposed into
  domain routers** — **all API paths byte-identical**. A generic `EntryPointRegistry`, `Protocol`
  narrowing, and **`openapi-typescript` type generation** for the client types. Typed config
  endpoints added (baseline / campaign / batch). New `soc/hooks/*`.

### Added / Fixed — G9: accessibility + adversarial audit (`a9e2b49`, `8b91fc0`, `05552c7`)
- **Accessibility** — `SEMANTIC_ICON` non-color signalling (never colour alone), **WCAG-2.2**
  criteria, **`jest-axe`** wired into the harness, **20 `jsx-a11y` rules at error** (findings
  **48 → 0**), `Field` labels associated throughout, flaky tests stabilized.
- **16-dimension adversarial audit** (`AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`) → **23 findings, 9 must-fix — all
  resolved with regression tests:** **C1** (custom dashboards couldn't persist), **H2** (rules
  verdict case-sensitivity bug), **H3** (a dashboards path billed the LLM), **H4** (19 unnamed
  comboboxes → accessible-name), plus **M1–M4**.
- **Polish (P1–P18)** — a page-consistency sweep across the surfaces.

### Fixed — long-standing bugs surfaced by the understanding maps + the audit
- **Auto-close dead-field** — the flagship auto-close toggle in Settings wrote a field
  `decide()` never read (it did nothing); it now writes `prefs.auto_close`, the exact field
  `decide()` already reads — so the toggle finally works, with `decide()` itself byte-identical.
- **KpiTile** delta-by-sign; **wizard** cosmetic demo toggle; **clipboard-over-http**;
  **misc-prefs clobber**; **automation** impossible-verdict; **roles** permission mismatch;
  **no-confirm destructive close** (now `ConfirmDialog`-gated); **campaigns** read-permission
  gate; the dead **`initAdmin`** stub; the **`request_approval`** dead-end; the **tuning** row
  always showing "Active"; a **SQL sort** no-op; and a **`derive_priority`** disagreement.

### Dependencies
- **Removed** `framer-motion` (zero importers). **Added** `react-grid-layout ^2.2.3` (runtime,
  loaded LAZILY in dashboard edit-mode only). Dev-only additions: `@fontsource-variable/inter`,
  `@fontsource/jetbrains-mono`, `@tailwindcss/container-queries`, `openapi-typescript`,
  `jest-axe`/`@axe-core`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`. **Backend: zero new runtime deps.**

### Verification (2026-07-02)
- Backend **1601 pytest** green (was 1461); webui `tsc + vite build` clean, **entry chunk
  264 kB** (was 537); **625 Vitest** specs green (was 273); eslint **0 errors** (4 warnings);
  `route_auth_coverage` green; the design-gate green; **`engine/case_manager.py` `decide()`
  BYTE-IDENTICAL** vs `27f0983` (#3 held throughout); **#6 / #9 / #2 / #10 upheld**; `PUT
  /api/settings` deep-MERGE intact; **all API paths byte-identical**. Developed on `Testing`
  (LOCAL only, NOT pushed).

## Development snapshot — 2026-07-01 — Round 4: multi-source poller fix, adaptive threshold auto-tuning, two-tier alert/event ingestion + campaign correlation + entity baseline, batch/flex + corrected model catalog, unified logs, tiered reset + fresh OOBE, login white-label

A fourth multi-wave round — **"fix the logic, fine-tune the product"** — delivering **3
confirmed bug fixes + 12 user requests** across 7 waves (W0–W6). Every wave was **additive**
and **default-OFF** with **zero new runtime dependencies** (the poller manager, threshold
tuner, campaign/baseline engines, event-detection funnel, batch providers, reset engine, and
all new KV stores are Python standard library; the webui composes the already-vendored
radix/shadcn stack). New stores are KV-doc (no new index/table/migration); new model fields
default so old persisted docs load unchanged. The non-negotiables hold throughout — in
particular **`case_manager.decide()` / `apply()` is byte-identical** (guard test): every new
capability that produces a case (the batched EVENT-detection funnel, the multi-source poller,
campaign correlation) re-enters the **same** correlate → decide pipeline and NEVER calls
`decide()` itself or reassigns a `cluster_signature` (#3/#4); the threshold tuner is a
config-writer that never imports `decide()` / risk weights / signatures (#3); **#6** stays one
LLM-gateway ledger write per real call (batch results are billed exactly-once via an atomic
claim-before-bill); **#7** (aggregate-then-summarise) and **#9** (untrusted fencing) held on
every new source/AI-influenceable value. The backend offline suite grew **1234 → 1461 tests
green** (W0 1235 · W1 1253 · W2 1263 · W3 1371 · W4 1437 · W6 1461); the webui `tsc + vite
build` is GREEN with the Vitest harness expanded **205 → 273 specs** (eslint clean, 0
`react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` errors). New here? See [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) and
`docs/research/2026-07-round4/`. Developed on the `Testing` branch (commits `3aeab6c`…`1df27ac`).

### Fixed — the 3 confirmed bugs
- **Single-source poller** — the poller only ever polled the primary source. NEW
  `engine/poller_manager.py` (`PollerManager` *is* `state.poller`) fans out over **every**
  enabled PULL source, each with its own connector (`es_client_for_source`, mgmt key forced
  `None`, #1), its own `{source.id}:{feed.id}` durable cursor (plus a legacy-`"primary"`-cursor-
  collision guard so two un-fed sources never stomp the shared cursor), its own entity strategy,
  and owned-client cleanup on rebuild/stop. The 0/1-source path is byte-identical. (#4)
- **`claude-opus-4-8` mispriced** — corrected **$15/$75 → $5/$25** across `llm/pricing.py` +
  `llm/model_registry.json` (incl. cache tiers + a 200K → 1M context bump), and broadened the
  Anthropic family; prompt-cache pricing is now applied (cache read 0.1× / write 1.25× 5m /
  2× 1h) and batch 0.5×; wired the previously-dead `providers.with_retry()` around the raw
  Anthropic/OpenAI HTTP calls.
- **`acknowledge`** — now transitions a case to `CaseStatus.INVESTIGATING` (a non-terminal
  status, not a close) and stamps `acknowledged_at`; previously it set the status to `None`.

### Added — Wave 1: hot-file contracts (`41ee54b`)
- Additive `UsageDoc` cache/batch fields; new `Campaign` / `CampaignEntity` / `BaselineState`
  (Welford + EWMA + t-digest) / `BatchJob` / `DetectionRule` models; `ActionType.{TUNING,RESET}`
  + 4 enums (`CampaignStatus` / `BatchJobState` / `DetectionSource` / `ResetScope`) + 4 KV
  namespaces (campaigns / baseline / batch_jobs / tuning). `Preferences.{threshold_tuning,batch,
  baseline,campaign}` + `caps.max_concurrent` + `BrandingConfig.login_*` (bounded plain-text,
  a validator rejecting any `<`, #9), all defaulted. `AutomationRule` → **`CaseAutomationRule`**
  with a module alias (wire key `threshold_automation` round-trips verbatim). `Case` gains
  advisory `campaign_id` / `detection_source` kept OUT of `case_manager.py`.

### Added — Wave 2: PollerManager (`f7509a3`)
- The multi-source poller bug fix above, with a per-manager fan-out under a
  `caps.max_concurrent` semaphore and a per-tick in-flight guard keyed on `cluster.signature`;
  `state.poller` becomes a `PollerManager` owning N per-source `Poller` children while still
  exposing `start` / `stop` / `poll_once` / `_source`.

### Added — Wave 3: engine capabilities (`b07f172`)
- **Adaptive threshold auto-tuning** — `engine/threshold_tuner.py` + `stores/tuning.py`: a
  nightly deterministic observer (per-rule FP via Wilson lower-bound + min-samples + EWMA) that
  bounded-bumps a correlation rule's `n` / a feed's `severity_floor` with an `ActionType.TUNING`
  audit + one-step rollback + a shadow-eval that blocks any change which would have hidden a
  confirmed TP; suppression DROPs route to a HITL Proposal. It is a config-writer only and
  **never** imports `case_manager` / `decide` / risk weights / signatures. **Default OFF.**
- **Daily campaign correlation** — `engine/campaigns.py` + `stores/campaigns.py`: a
  deterministic shared-entity graph of cases (≥2 cases + ≥1 shared entity → an idempotent
  `Campaign`) that only *references* `case_ids` — never re-clusters or closes (#3/#4).
- **Entity baseline** — `engine/baseline.py` + `stores/baseline.py`: online EWMA mean + EWMV
  variance per `cluster_signature` over 168 hour-of-week buckets (α from a 14-day half-life),
  a bounded t-digest (p50/p95/p99), robust modified-z |M|>3.5, warm-up 3× period; a pure
  deterministic producer that never reads `decide()` / risk weights.
- **Two-tier alert/event ingestion** — `engine/event_detection.py`: a cheap-first EVENT-feed
  funnel (pre-aggregate → deterministic rules → anomaly [baseline] → batched Haiku detection,
  #7 aggregate-only, #9 fenced) whose survivors **re-enter the same correlate pipeline** and
  reach the same `cluster_signature` (#4) + the unchanged `decide()` (#3) + `engine/forwarding.py`
  (`explain_forwarding`, a read-only forwarding explainer).
- **Batch/flex + cache economics** — `pricing.cost_for` applies cache/batch rates (non-cache
  path byte-identical); `providers.py` extracts Anthropic/OpenAI cache tokens + an OpenAI
  `service_tier='flex'` opt-in; NEW `llm/batch.py` `BatchProvider` SPI (Anthropic
  `/v1/messages/batches` + OpenAI `/v1/batches`, results UNORDERED → keyed by `custom_id`) +
  `stores/batch_jobs.py` (resume-safe, exactly-one UsageDoc/result at 0.5× batch, #6).

### Added — Wave 4: API surface + runtime wiring (`11ea46e`)
- **6 new routers** mounted under `require_auth`: `routes_tuning` (recommendations dry-run +
  config + apply/rollback, `ActionType.TUNING` audited, shadow-blocked → HITL Proposal),
  `routes_campaigns`, `routes_baseline`, `routes_batch` (read-only, secret-free), `routes_reset`,
  and the public-allowlisted `routes_setup`.
- **Tiered reset** — `engine/reset.py` + `POST /api/admin/reset {scope,confirm}` (admin +
  `require_fresh_auth`, type-to-confirm): a cases tier clears cases/campaigns/baseline/inbox/
  collab/batch-jobs/live-tail but **keeps the cost ledger + audit**; sources tier adds
  sources/cursors; factory tier adds users/sessions/prefs/roles/proposals/memory/branding and
  flips `setup_complete=false` → OOBE. **Env secrets are byte-identical across every tier**
  (airtight test); audited before acting (#2).
- **Fresh OOBE** — `routes_setup.py`: `GET /api/setup/status` + `POST /api/setup/account`
  (public, self-locking first-super_admin, forced strong password ≥12 / ≠ username / not-common,
  MFA prompted-optional).
- **Unified logs** — `GET /api/logs` scatter-gathers browse-capable sources
  (`asyncio.gather` + per-source `wait_for`, mandatory source provenance, secrets never
  returned, read-only #1) + `GET /api/cases/{id}/forwarding` + `GET /api/sources/health`.
- **Gated schedulers** — nightly tuner / daily campaign / batch-jobs poller spawn-but-sleep
  when disabled (byte-identical default-off boot); EVENT-feed routing to the funnel engages
  only when batch + baseline are both enabled (default-off = the existing realtime path,
  byte-identical); demo / kill-switch gate it off.

### Added — Wave 5: webui surfaces + consolidation (`3c68cf5`)
- A `UnifiedLogsSheet` (10s live-tail + partial-failure strip, #9 plain-text); a **Tuning**
  page (recommendations + apply/rollback + config, honest "only changes what's investigated,
  never closes" framing, DROP → Approvals) + **Campaigns** page + `CampaignChip`; **Baseline**
  warm-up gauges (n/target + p50/p95/p99) + a **Batch jobs** viewer; a cleaner **CaseDetail**
  (single primary CTA + a unified Close-with-disposition dialog that posts the existing
  close → `decide()`, #3); an **analytics declutter** (Cost as the single home); a **login
  white-label** (`BrandHero` renders `BrandingConfig.login_*` bounded plain-text + curated
  layouts, no raw HTML/SVG, #9) + an OOBE account-setup step; **Models** catalog cache/batch
  pricing columns; a **DangerZone** reset panel (3 tiered type-to-confirm cards, super_admin,
  env-secrets-preserved copy). (`vitest 214 → 273`; lint 0 rules-of-hooks; backend untouched.)

### Fixed / Security — Wave 6: adversarial audit + harden (`1df27ac`)
- A **16-dimension adversarial audit** found **16 confirmed / 4 refuted** findings (2 HIGH, 6
  MEDIUM, 8 LOW), all fixed + regression-tested (+24 tests):
  - **HIGH (poller concurrency, #4)** — a per-`cluster_signature` `asyncio.Lock` on the ONE
    pipeline now serialises `find_open_by_signature` → save across the fan-out, so concurrent
    sources/ticks create **exactly one** case; the fragile in-flight monkeypatch was deleted for
    a per-manager `_poll_lock` serialising whole ticks (loop vs manual `/api/poll`).
  - **MEDIUM** — batched EVENT-detection now **really** creates cases (survivors persist as
    `BatchJob.candidates` and re-enter via `register_candidate` + `investigate_cluster` → same
    `cluster_signature` #4, unchanged `decide()` #3); the tuner shadow-eval now pages
    CLOSED + RESOLVED so it isn't blind to RESOLVED TPs, and is cadence-gated (bumps once/window);
    the OpenAI prompt-cache is no longer double-billed; the legacy public `/api/setup/init-admin`
    (which bypassed the strong-pw policy) was **removed** — the sole first-admin writer is now the
    policy-enforced `/api/setup/account`.
  - **LOW** — batch `process_results` dedup is now an atomic CAS claim-before-bill (#6
    exactly-once under concurrency); setup self-lock fails safe + is race-safe; the t-digest
    centroid count is bounded (~O(compression)).

### Notes
- **Terminology cleanup (UI/docs only; wire keys + aliases kept)** — event / detection / alert /
  case / campaign; "correlate" → Auto-investigate / clustering / campaign-correlation; "rule" →
  detection-rule / case-automation (`AutomationRule` → `CaseAutomationRule` alias; the stored
  `threshold_automation` wire key is unchanged and round-trips verbatim).
- **Two-tier ingestion, in one line:** ALERT feeds = realtime per-alert (+ daily campaign
  correlation); EVENT feeds = batched agent-driven detection creating candidate cases that
  re-enter the same deterministic pipeline. Both new subsystems are **default OFF**.
- **Deferred / known:** admin-page consolidation-redirects (#4 — the pages work + deep-link
  standalone) and a dead `api.setup.initAdmin` webui stub (never called; live OOBE uses
  `/api/setup/account`).

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-30 — Round 3: shared KV substrate, EnrichmentProvider SPI, custom-role/deny RBAC, SSE EventBus, posture/MITRE-coverage metrics, shift report, in-app notifications, Models page + BudgetGate, case collaboration, triage chips + trace

A third multi-wave round delivering **12 user requests** ("useful, distinctive, fine-grained")
across Waves 0–4 plus one ship-regardless security fix. Every wave was **additive** with
**zero new runtime dependencies** (the SSE bus, the SigV4 Bedrock ladder, the enrichment
SPI, the budget gate, and all the new KV stores are Python standard library; the webui
composes the already-vendored radix/shadcn/framer/recharts/cmdk). New stores are KV-doc
(no new index/table/migration); new model fields default so old persisted docs load
unchanged. The non-negotiables hold throughout — in particular **`case_manager.decide()` /
`apply()` is byte-identical** (guard test): the new `BudgetGate` is a pure **pre-flight**
that fails safe to NEEDS_HUMAN and is **never** an auto-close path; **#6** (one LLM-gateway
ledger write per real call — the budget gate raises *before* the call and *before* any
write); **#7** (Standup stays aggregate-then-summarise); and **#9** (every new
log/source/operator/AI-influenceable value is fenced before a prompt and escaped in the
UI). The backend offline suite grew **794 → 1142 tests green**; the webui `tsc + vite
build` is GREEN with the dev-only Vitest harness expanded to **181 specs** (eslint clean,
0 `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` errors). New here? See [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md)
and `docs/research/2026-06-round3/IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Developed on the `Testing` branch
(commits `bffe4b8`…`3610147` + the live-wiring / security / docs wave).

### Added — Wave 0: hot-file foundations (`bffe4b8`)
- Additive `Case` advisory axes (severity / impact / priority chips) + SLA datetimes; 11
  new model classes + 4 enums + 8 KV namespaces + 4 `Preferences` blocks + 13 optional
  `Secrets` provider slots, all defaulted (old docs load unchanged). Webui route
  **code-split** (`React.lazy` + manual chunks) so the bundle stays small.

### Added — Wave 1: shared substrate (`59c2999`)
- **8 KV-doc stores** (`case_thread` / `case_activity` / `case_tasks` / `inbox` /
  `notif_prefs` / `custom_roles` / `price_overlay` / `shift_handoff`) over the existing KV
  layer — no new index/table.
- **`EnrichmentProvider` SPI** (`enrichment/`: base ABC + registry + dispatch + aggregate)
  with a `tlsoc.enrichers` entry-point group; the default `max()` fusion is byte-identical
  to the legacy path, weighted fusion is opt-in.
- **Multiplexed SSE `EventBus`** (`realtime.py`, `GET /api/events`, **default OFF** with a
  graceful polling fallback) — pure transport, frames published AFTER save, never feeds
  `decide()`.
- **RBAC resource split** + custom-role / inheritance / explicit-**DENY** `effective_matrix()`.

### Added — Wave 2: backend features (`2295363`)
- **Posture metrics + MITRE coverage** — server-side MTTA/MTTR/dwell (p50/p90), SLA/aging,
  quality mix, period-over-period deltas, MITRE coverage vs the bundled 697-technique
  corpus + an ATT&CK Navigator layer export (`routes_metrics.py`).
- **Shift report** — `engine/shift_report.py` (a forward attention queue ranked by an
  urgency = risk/severity/age/SLA score + SLA aging + per-analyst workload + deltas, all
  deterministic, no LLM) folded into `StandupService`; the forward-looking JSON still goes
  to the cheap model as a compact fenced aggregate (#7/#9). `routes_standup.py`.
- **Enrichment providers** — **17 new providers** behind the SPI (**19 registered**
  classes; abuse.ch is one config entry spanning the urlhaus/threatfox/malwarebazaar
  classes) with multi-indicator routing (IP/domain/hash/url/email), per-provider rate
  guard, fail-open + cached (`routes_enrichment.py`).
- **Models registry + `BudgetGate`** — a `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` replacing the gateway
  if/elif + a bundled `llm/model_registry.json` + operator **price overlays**; a pure
  pre-flight `BudgetGate` (`engine/budget.py`) that raises **before** any billable
  completion (never an auto-close) (`routes_models.py`).
- **In-app channel** — an `InAppChannel` fanning out to the per-user `InboxStore` (no
  network) (`routes_inapp.py`); **case collaboration** (threaded human/ai/system messages
  + reactions + tasks + @mentions → inbox + an activity feed) (`routes_cases_collab.py`);
  **triage/priority** chips + a typed ReAct trace timeline (`routes_triage.py`);
  **custom-role CRUD** + preview/simulate/assignment (`routes_roles.py`).

### Added — Wave 2.5: backend gap-closure (`8b25ca2`)
- **Cloud LLM, first-class** — `Provider` widened to `azure` / `bedrock` / `vertex` /
  `openai_compatible`; the gateway authenticates Azure, **Bedrock via a stdlib SigV4 ladder
  (no `boto3`)**, and Vertex (OAuth Bearer); 12 cloud/enrichment `Secrets` (booleans-only
  in `public()`); `ProjectHoneypotProvider` registered.
- **Server-side custom-role enforcement** — a pure `can_for_roles(base, custom_roles, …)`
  (role-union, deny-wins, super_admin hard-allow) drives `_enforce`, so assigned custom
  roles are honored on routes (consistent with `/api/account/permissions`).
- **Test netguard** — an autouse `conftest` socket guard blocks non-loopback egress (opt
  out per test with `@pytest.mark.allow_network`), keeping the enrichment tests
  deterministic + offline.

### Added — Wave 3: webui surfaces (`3610147`)
- Hamburger **`NavSidebar`** (two width states, Cmd/Ctrl+B) + a **`NotificationBell`**;
  a Settings **card-grid** + `BrandingEditor`; a **Roles** matrix editor; a standalone
  **Models** page; **Metrics** tabs + a MITRE heatmap; a **Standup** attention queue;
  CaseDetail's **4 triage chips** + `TraceTimeline` + threaded collaboration; an **Inbox**;
  and an `EnrichmentProvidersEditor`. (webui `tsc --noEmit && vite build` exit 0,
  code-split preserved; #9 audit PASS — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on data, untrusted
  values escaped, secrets boolean-only.)

### Fixed / Security — Wave 4: live wiring + RAG-fencing TRUSTED allowlist
- **RAG-knowledge fencing inverted to a TRUSTED allow-list** — operator-imported RAG
  documents previously rendered to the model **unfenced**; now only the built-in/verified
  corpus is TRUSTED and everything else is fenced UNTRUSTED before any prompt, closing an
  **OWASP-LLM01** prompt-injection gap (no behavior change for legitimate content).
- **Live SSE wiring** (poller / dispatch / pipeline → `EventBus`; webui `EventSource`
  with a polling fallback, still default-OFF); **`PUT /api/branding`** server-side
  contrast-warning computation; a WCAG 2.2 polish pass; and a docs sync.

### Notes
- The **~25 Round-3 cloud-LLM + enrichment secrets** are now wired through both deploy
  compose files (`deploy/docker-compose.{agnostic,tlsoc}.yml`) as commented-optional
  `TLSOC_*` → unprefixed passthroughs, so the documented durable `.env` path works
  end-to-end (`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` §2.6–2.7, `.env.example`).
- All new providers are **default-off** and **advisory only** — enrichment never feeds the
  deterministic close/escalate decision (#3).

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-30 — Round 2: account/sessions, Settings IA, Demo Mode, per-feed sources, email + customization

A second multi-wave round focused on operator experience: a redesigned login + account
self-service, real sessions with an access policy, a Settings-centric information
architecture, a reversible/isolated Demo Mode, per-feed source configuration, Resend +
SES email channels with customizable templates, pervasive per-user customization, and a
command palette + global search + bulk actions + audit viewer. Every wave was
**additive** with **zero new runtime dependencies** (sessions/JWT, the template renderer,
the SES SMTP-credential derivation, and the per-user prefs store are all Python standard
library; the webui composes the existing vendored shadcn + Tailwind). The backend offline
suite grew **649 → 794 tests green**; the webui `tsc + vite build` is GREEN with the
dev-only Vitest harness expanded to **86 tests** (19 files), and eslint is clean
(0 `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` errors, 2 exhaustive-deps warnings). The
non-negotiables hold throughout — in particular **`case_manager.decide()` is
byte-identical** (CI-verified): Demo Mode runs FP through the real `decide()` against
a *sandboxed* policy copy (live policy untouched) and keeps NEEDS_HUMAN open; bulk
actions run the analyst human-action path, never an auto-close; templates/terminology
only ever RECOMMEND/relabel and all untrusted text stays fenced (#9). New here? See
[`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md). Developed on the `Testing` branch
(commits `6adf195`…`763ded9`).

### Added — Wave 1: critical bug fixes
- Webui/presentational fixes (RiskGauge, MFA QR + copy, a duplicate close `X`, chat
  framing, store-degraded UX). The store-degraded notice is derived client-side from
  `/api/health.store_type` (in-memory-store detection); the health endpoint returns
  `{status, version, es_connected, store_type, setup_complete}` (no `persistent` field).
  No data-model changes.

### Added — Wave 2: login redesign + account self-service
- **Two-column login** (brand hero + form) restyling the existing 4-mode `Login.tsx`
  with no change to any submit handler or the mode state machine; per-provider SSO brand
  icons, a segmented MFA OTP, and a client-only password-strength meter (no new dep).
- **Self-service profile** — additive defaulted `User` fields (`display_name` / `alias` /
  `avatar` / `alt_email` / `timezone` / `locale` / `prefs`; old KV docs load unchanged,
  no migration) projected through `User.public()` (secrets stay excluded). Routes:
  `GET/PUT /api/account/me` (env-managed single-admin is read-only → 400) and
  `PUT /api/me/avatar`. The avatar validator allows only small `data:image/(png|webp|jpeg)`
  (rejects SVG/oversize/malformed), magic-byte sniffed and capped.

### Added — Wave 3: sessions & access policy
- **SessionStore** (`stores/sessions.py`, over the existing KV layer; EsKVStore /
  SqlKVStore adapters; persisted so it survives `_wire()` rebuilds and an ephemeral JWT
  secret). Access tokens now carry a `sid` (128-bit) + `tv` (token_version) claim, minted
  at all session-create sites (login / mfa-verify / sso-callback).
- **Enforcement in `require_auth`** (async — not in the sync hot-path `verify()`): reject
  missing / revoked / `tv`-mismatch / past-absolute / past-idle, lazily bumping
  `last_active`; failures return `401 {code: session_invalid|session_expired|reauth_required}`.
  `require_fresh_auth(window)` is a step-up gate. The no-auth no-op path is preserved.
- **Refresh rotation + reuse detection** — a replay of the previous refresh hash is treated
  as theft (revoke + bump `tv` + audit + notify). Routes: `POST /api/auth/refresh`,
  `POST /api/auth/reauth`; own-session `GET /api/sessions`,
  `POST /api/sessions/{sid}/revoke`, `POST /api/sessions/revoke-others`; admin
  `GET /api/admin/sessions`, `POST /api/admin/sessions/{sid}/revoke`. A UI-editable token
  policy (access TTL / idle / absolute / refresh TTL / sudo window + notify toggles) on
  Preferences. Every create/revoke is audited (#2).

### Added / Changed — Wave 4: Settings-centric IA consolidation
- **Two-scope Settings** (Personal Account / Organization) in one left rail with grouped
  headers; Users / Security / SSO and the W2 profile / W3 sessions pages move into Settings
  sub-sections, with RBAC hiding sections the role can't see (allow-all when auth/rbac off).
  No new endpoints — Settings round-trips via the existing `/api/settings`, `/api/branding`,
  `/api/roles` + the W2/W3 routes.
- **Page consolidation** — near-duplicate top-level pages folded into tabbed surfaces and
  the rail grouped into a handful of areas (Overview / Triage / Intelligence / Analytics /
  Admin), honouring the ONE-chat-engine rule. Settings hook ordering kept above the early
  returns (guards against React #310).

### Added — Wave 5: Demo Mode + Experimental Settings
- **Reversible, isolated, $0 Demo Mode** — a first-class tenant `demo.mode`
  (`off` / `seeded` / `live`) on Preferences. A `DemoPullConnector` + `demo_generator`
  (a fixed fictional org, a diurnal-Poisson benign baseline, and seeded MITRE ATT&CK
  storylines) feed synthetic OCSF events through the REAL pipeline, but generated
  workload writes land in a SEPARATE in-memory store with a deterministic mock LLM
  (`pricing_source='zero'`, a plausible synthetic `$`). The real poll path is gated
  so the durable cursor (#4) is
  untouched; cases are run-tagged + `demo`-tagged (seeded IDs are also namespaced). FP
  runs through the real `decide()` against a *sandboxed* AutoClosePolicy copy;
  NEEDS_HUMAN stays open. Routes:
  `POST /api/demo/{enable,incident,reset,disable}`, `GET /api/demo/status`
  (`demo:manage` for mutations). A demo banner + `(simulated)` labels + a write-guard
  keep demo and prod distinct; lifecycle mutations intentionally remain in the real audit.

### Added — Wave 6: per-feed source configuration
- **`IndexPattern` → richer per-feed `Feed`** (same wire key `config['index_patterns']`,
  back-compat: legacy `{pattern, role, auto_correlate}` and bare-string entries still
  validate). Adds an **`ignore`** `IndexRole`; splits the overloaded `auto_correlate` into
  `correlate` + `auto_investigate` with a behaviour-preserving migration; and adds per-feed
  `query` (connector-native, operator-TRUSTED), field-mapping override, `message_field`,
  `severity_floor`, and an optional schedule. `engine/poller.py` keys a **durable cursor
  per `{source.id}:{feed.id}`** so a fast alerts feed and a slow events feed never skip
  (#4); a severity floor demotes auto-forwarding but registers a candidate and **never
  drops events** (#4); `IGNORE` feeds skip ingest and are excluded from the derived
  `data_view_pattern`. `/api/sources` round-trips the config verbatim (no new endpoint).

### Added / Changed — Wave 7: email (Resend + SES + templates) + pervasive customization
- **Resend channel** (`notifications/resend.py`, type `resend`) — an HTTPS-API channel over
  the `_HttpChannel` base (Bearer key, optional idempotency key, client-side rate limit,
  retry only on 429/5xx). **Amazon SES** ships as an email SMTP preset
  (`email-smtp.{region}.amazonaws.com`) that can derive the SMTP password from a raw IAM
  key pair via a stdlib HMAC chain — no new dep, SMTP as the simple default.
- **Customizable email templates** (`notifications/templates.py`) — a ~80-LOC stdlib
  mustache-subset renderer (`{{var}}` auto-escaped via `html.escape`, `{{{var}}}` raw only
  for trusted header HTML, sections, dotted lookup, no eval/getattr) with `header_safe()`
  (CRLF/header-injection guard) and `text_safe()`. 5 preloaded, operator-overridable
  templates (`case.new` / `case.escalation` / `case.resolved` / `digest.daily` / `test`);
  server-side render via `POST /api/notifications/preview`. Deterministic threading headers
  (`Message-Id` / `In-Reply-To` / `References` / `X-TLSOC-*`).
- **Per-user customization** — a `UserPrefsStore` (`stores/user_prefs.py`, over the KV
  layer, keyed by user, `'default'` when auth off; no new index) plus org-level Preferences
  hold **saved views**, per-table column state, **terminology** overrides, and a personal
  light/dark/system theme, resolved through a merged cascade. Routes:
  `GET /api/prefs/effective`, `GET/PUT /api/prefs/{user,org}` (org PUT admin),
  `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/views` (+ `POST /api/views/{id}/clone`),
  `PUT /api/prefs/user/tables/{table_id}`, `GET/PUT /api/terminology` (PUT admin).
- **Command palette, global search, bulk actions, audit viewer** — a Cmd/Ctrl-K palette;
  a cross-entity **global search** (`GET /api/search`); **bulk case actions**
  (`POST /api/cases/bulk`, max 500 ids) that run each id through the EXACT single-case human
  action path (`_perform_case_action`) — RBAC enforced up front, each case audited
  individually, partial-failure tolerant, NEVER `case_manager.decide()`; and an **audit
  viewer** (`GET /api/audit`) over the append-only trail.

### Fixed — Audit & remediation (commits `aae7a76` + `763ded9`)
- **16-agent adversarial audit** (commit `aae7a76`) — a fleet review of the full Round 2
  surface (RBAC gates, the poller cursor, sessions, Demo Mode, email templates, the gauge)
  plus a docs refresh and `docs/research/2026-06-round2/ROUND2_AUDIT.md`. It surfaced real
  bugs → **8 confirmed fixes auto-applied**, mostly missing/incorrect RBAC gates (no-ops in
  the default-OFF profile), a poller cursor edge case, and a RiskGauge rendering bug.
- **HIGH/MEDIUM remediation** (commit `763ded9`, **+22 regression tests**) — the confirmed
  review items: **#4 feed cursor starvation** (a fast feed could starve a slow one — each
  `{source.id}:{feed.id}` advances independently); **demo-chat isolation** (chat in Demo
  Mode stays on the sandboxed in-memory store); **env single-admin token-version lockout**
  (the env-managed admin no longer self-locks on a `tv` bump); **`set_status` → `RESOLVED`
  RBAC** (resolving via `set_status` now requires the same permission as `resolve`); and
  **email hardening** — `text_safe()` on plain-text bodies, `{{{ }}}` raw-output restricted
  to trusted header HTML, and branding-SVG rejection. A **strengthened authZ-coverage CI
  test** now **fails if any non-GET `/api` route lacks an authZ gate**.
- Deferred / low-severity items are tracked in
  `docs/research/2026-06-round2/ROUND2_AUDIT.md` (session-KV optimistic concurrency,
  multi-generation refresh-reuse, an ES-only CONFIG_INDEX nested-type collision, a cosmetic
  deep-link breadcrumb); the best-of-best Tier 2/3 backlog (API keys, dashboard builder,
  scheduled reports, watchlists, SLA timers, a hunting/query builder) is in
  `docs/research/2026-06-round2/ROUND2_BEST_OF_BEST.md`.

### Notes
- Auth remains **DEFAULT OFF**; sessions/account/customization gates no-op when auth is off
  (`'default'` user prefs, allow-all RBAC), preserving the zero-auth back-compat behaviour
  and the offline suite. Enabling it (`TLSOC_AUTH_ENABLED=true`) seeds an
  `Admin` / `Admin@123` super-admin (forced password change on first login).
- **Run the demo locally:** `./scripts/run-demo.sh` (backend on :8088, webui on :5173).

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-29 — Agentic SOC overhaul (Waves 1–7)

A seven-wave SOC overhaul: multi-user identity + RBAC, MFA + SSO, a two-axis case
taxonomy + custom case IDs, pluggable notifications, multi-source / cross-source
correlation, playbook automation + threat context, and a consolidated Settings +
UI pass. Every wave was **additive** with **zero new runtime dependencies**
(MFA/TOTP, SSO, and SMTP email all use the Python standard library). The backend
offline suite grew **395 → 649 tests green**; the webui `tsc + vite build` is GREEN
with a dev-only Vitest harness (27 tests). The non-negotiables hold throughout —
in particular **`case_manager.decide()` is byte-identical** (CI-verified): the new
status/disposition taxonomy, notifications, and threshold automation all sit on an
additive layer and run only *after* the deterministic decision. Developed on the
`Testing` branch (commits since `91f8616`).

### Added — Wave 1: identity (multi-user + RBAC)
- **Persisted multi-user store** backed by the existing KV layer (no new index or
  SQL table); a first-run **OOBE** creates the first admin, and when auth is enabled
  on an empty store the suite seeds an `Admin` / `Admin@123` **super_admin** with a
  `must_change_password` flag (forced replacement on first login).
- **Six-role RBAC** (`super_admin` / `soc_manager` / `analyst_tier2` /
  `analyst_tier1` / `responder` / `auditor`) with a permission matrix
  (`app/rbac/policy.py`), `require_permission` / `require_role` FastAPI deps on every
  state-changing route, and React `<Can>` guards filtering nav + actions. Routes:
  `POST /api/setup/init-admin`, `POST /api/auth/change-password`,
  `GET /api/roles`, `GET|POST /api/users`, `PUT|DELETE /api/users/{username}`.

### Added — Wave 2: MFA + SSO
- **MFA (TOTP)** — stdlib RFC-6238 (verified against the official RFC test vectors),
  a browser **inline-SVG QR** enrolment (no QR dependency), single-use recovery
  codes, and a two-phase login (password → `requires_mfa` → verify). Routes:
  `POST /api/auth/mfa/{setup,confirm,verify,disable}`.
- **SSO (OIDC)** — Google / Microsoft / generic providers via **server-side code
  exchange + `userinfo`** (no `id_token`-signature-verify dependency), with
  group→role auto-provisioning. Routes: `GET /api/auth/sso/{providers,authorize,
  callback}`, `POST /api/auth/sso/providers/{id}/secret`.

### Added — Wave 3: case taxonomy + custom case IDs
- **Two-axis taxonomy** — `CaseStatus` extended additively
  (`new` / `investigating` / `escalated` / `on_hold` / `resolved`; `open` /
  `needs_human` / `closed` retained, `needs_human` kept as a deprecated alias) plus
  a new `Disposition` enum (`true_positive` / `false_positive` / `benign` /
  `suspicious` / `duplicate` / `undetermined`). New lifecycle actions
  (`hold` / `resume` / `resolve` / `set_status` / `set_disposition` / `deescalate`)
  on `POST /api/cases/{id}/action` with a transition guard (illegal moves → 400) and
  a status history. **`decide()` is byte-identical** — the taxonomy is layered in
  `apply()` and analyst actions only.
- **Customizable case-ID nomenclature** — `engine/case_id.py` renders a template
  (e.g. `CASE-{year}-{seq:06d}`) backed by an atomic KV sequence, with a live preview
  via `POST /api/settings/case-id/preview`. `Case.case_number` is additive; the
  immutable `case_id` is unchanged.

### Added — Wave 4: notifications
- **Pluggable `NotificationChannel`** abstraction (`app/notifications/`) with
  **email** over stdlib SMTP (**13 provider presets** — gmail / o365 / yahoo / zoho /
  icloud / sendgrid / mailgun / postmark / brevo / sparkpost / … + custom), plus
  **Slack / Microsoft Teams / webhook / PagerDuty / Telegram** channels. Per-condition
  triggers (create / verdict-change / escalate / close) with dedup, per-recipient
  rate-limiting, and digest batching; sends are **fire-and-forget after `apply()` +
  save** (never inside `decide()`) and audited. Channel secrets live in the secret
  tier. Routes: `GET /api/notifications/providers`, `POST /api/notifications/test`,
  `POST /api/notifications/channels/{id}/secret`, `POST /api/cases/{id}/notify`.

### Added — Wave 5: multi-source + cross-source correlation
- **Auto-Correlate toggle** per **source** *and* per **sub-source** (the
  `events` / `alerts` index pattern); disabling it routes that source's clusters to
  candidates instead of auto-forwarding.
- **Opt-in cross-source correlation** (`CrossSourceCorrelationConfig`,
  default OFF) links **RELATED** cases that share an entity (IP / host / user /
  file hash / domain) within a window — surfaced as related cases, **not** a forced
  merge (the 1:1 cluster→case signature/audit invariant is preserved).
- **Per-source field-mapping overrides** + per-connector **contextual setup help**
  (`AuthField.help_link` / `help_code`, rendered as `HelpTip`s) + an
  analyze-a-sample affordance.

### Added — Wave 6: automation + threat context
- **Run-a-playbook** action (`POST /api/cases/{id}/run-playbook`) re-investigates a
  case through the shared pipeline with the chosen playbook **forced as context**
  (recommend-only, #3-safe).
- **Threshold automation** (`engine/threshold_automation.py`, default OFF) matches
  cases *after* the decision and may **tag / recommend / notify / run a playbook /
  request approval** (→ a HITL `Proposal`) — but it **never sets status directly**;
  `NEEDS_HUMAN` never auto-closes.
- **Threat-context panel** (`GET /api/cases/{id}/threat-context`) assembles IOC
  reputation, a **bundled MITRE ATT&CK corpus (697 techniques)**, and related cases,
  **fail-open** per section. A resolved-case → RAG knowledge loop auto-chunks a
  closed case into the corpus so future investigations retrieve prior decisions;
  `POST /api/threat-context/import` ingests threat-intel docs (fenced UNTRUSTED).

### Added / Changed — Wave 7: consolidated Settings + UI
- **Consolidated Settings** — a single surface across **13 sections / 4 nav groups**
  (Data Sources, Models & LLM, Correlation & Cases, Automation, Notifications,
  Security, Knowledge & Threat Context, Enrichment, Appearance, Advanced, plus the
  admin areas). Everything rides `GET/PUT /api/settings` (deep-merge + validate);
  `GET /api/settings/schema` and `GET /api/settings/{section}` support form
  generation.
- **UI cleanup** — RiskGauge redesign (fixes the Active-Risk-Index gauge glitch),
  skeleton/shimmer loading + staggered reveals, 8px-grid alignment, and a WCAG-AA
  contrast pass. The UI stack is Vite + React + **Tailwind + shadcn** (the legacy
  `@elastic/eui` surface was removed).

### Notes
- **Auth is DEFAULT OFF** (`Secrets.auth_enabled`) for back-compat and the offline
  tests. Enable it with `TLSOC_AUTH_ENABLED=true` to get the login screen, the OOBE,
  and the `Admin` / `Admin@123` seed (which must be changed on first login).

---

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-24 — HITL proposal approvals, white-screen fix + error boundary, cost/branding

Backend offline suite **395 tests green** (was 380); webui `npm run build` GREEN +
a new dev-only Vitest harness; no new runtime npm deps. Additive; the 12 non-negotiables
intact — **`case_manager.decide()` is byte-identical (verified in tests)**; suppression
is a pre-LLM cost-gate filter only; human approval is the ONLY write path. Developed on
the `Testing` branch.

### Fixed
- **"Notes & feedback" tab white-screened the whole app** — four `<EuiAvatar color={tint(...)}>`
  passed an `rgba()` string, which EUI 95's EuiAvatar rejects (throws unless a valid hex /
  'plain' / 'subdued'); with no error boundary the throw unmounted the entire tree.
  Removed the `tint()` wrapper on the 4 avatars (EuiBadge tint() usages are fine and kept).
- **Added a top-level React ErrorBoundary** (flyout tab body + app root, resets on
  tab/case/page change) so any future render throw degrades to a callout instead of a
  white screen. (Audit confirmed the other suspected EuiIcon/EuiAvatar "crashes" were
  false alarms — EuiIcon accepts CSS colors, EuiAvatar accepts hex.)

### Added
- **Agent-drafted suppression/asset PROPOSALS with human approval (HITL)** — on FP-confirm/
  close, a code-guarded proposer drafts a *pending* `Proposal` (suppression `field==value`
  only from values literally present in the case's events; hard denylist of over-broad
  selectors; fail-safe so it can never break the close). `GET /api/proposals`, `POST
  /api/proposals/{id}/approve|reject` (approve appends a live `SuppressionRule` via the
  settings write path or a `MemoryEntry`; admin-gated via a `require_admin` seam). Webui
  **Approvals** queue. `SuppressionRule` gained `enabled`/`expires_at`/provenance, honored
  by the cost gate.
- **Deeper Cost & usage breakdown** — sortable detailed ledger (cost/%/tokens/calls/avg
  cost-per-call/cost-per-1K-tokens) across Model/Role/Surface/Top-drivers, composition
  donut with "Other" roll-up, spend-over-time stats, efficiency tiles.
- **Expanded white-label branding** — favicon, secondary accent, login subtitle, footer
  text, support URL, default-dark-mode (validated, additive).

### Deferred (unchanged from prior round; designed in docs/research/CUSTOMIZATION_AND_RBAC.md)
- Full RBAC enforcement (the `require_admin` seam is default-allow today with a clear TODO).
- True cross-source aggregation.

---

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-23 — Deep source customizability, no-IP fix, UI standardization + chat rebuild

Backend offline suite **380 tests green** (was 364); webui `npm run build` GREEN,
no new npm deps. Additive; the spine and the 12 non-negotiables intact (#3 the
close/escalate decision stays deterministic; #1 read-only scoped access; #4 case
idempotency). Developed on the `Testing` branch.

### Fixed
- **No-source-IP alerts were silently dropped** — correlation grouped by a single
  entity and discarded events whose entity field was null, so a source without
  `source.ip` produced **no cases**. Now entity-agnostic: `entity_strategy`
  (per-source or global, default `auto`) falls back **IP→host→user→rule** so a case
  always forms; the entity type used is recorded on the case. Back-compat preserved.
- **Chat layout glitch + wasted space** — the result table detached/clipped and the
  panel left large empty bands (brittle `calc(100vh-160px)` + an unconstrained
  table). Rebuilt as a robust full-height flex layout; result tables now scroll
  within the bubble and **all-empty columns are hidden** (no more wall of `—`).
- Standup render hardening carried forward; invalid icons removed.

### Added
- **Per-source multiple index patterns with roles** — `config.index_patterns:
  [{pattern, role}]`; `alerts`-role patterns auto-investigate every match (SIEM
  alerts), `events`-role correlate then triage. N patterns; back-compat with the
  single `data_view_pattern`. Editable in the source wizard/manager.
- **`source_id`/`source_name` on every case** + a **filter-by-source** facet and
  comprehensive **sort options** on Cases & Automated-scans; a **source selector** in
  Chat (default "All sources"); `POST /chat` gained `source_id` scoping.
- **Per-source field mapping + `message_field` + entity-strategy selector**, and a
  **CA-certificate file picker + drag-and-drop** (PEM) alongside paste.
- **Knowledge & Memory upgrades** — sortable/filterable/density-toggle documents
  table, multi-file batch import with progress, ranked retrieval with relevance
  scores; Memory KPIs, search/category/author/active filters, sort, group-by-category.
- **Read-only Test-connection clarity** — the success callout explains the
  `read_only` mode (cluster-monitor not required).
- **UI standardization** — a design-token layer (`SPACE`/`RADIUS`/`WEIGHT`/
  `MAX_CONTENT_WIDTH`), denser/cleaner primitives, refined Shell nav + global CSS
  (hover elevation, focus rings, scrollbars, GPU-friendly transitions), and a
  redesigned **Notes & feedback** tab + denser in-case **Ask** chat.
- **Research + design docs** — `docs/research/UX_AND_DESIGN.md` and
  `docs/research/CUSTOMIZATION_AND_RBAC.md` (competitor study + an RBAC/user-management
  design and a cross-source-aggregation design, both scoped as the next round).

### Deferred (designed, documented in docs/research/CUSTOMIZATION_AND_RBAC.md)
- **RBAC + user management** (roles admin/analyst/viewer, route-layer capability gate,
  Users admin UI) — a dedicated security-focused follow-up.
- **True cross-source aggregation** (poll/query all configured sources) — today only
  the primary pull source is actively polled; chat source-select is single-source.

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-23 — UI polish, filtering, in-case chat, reinvestigate + icon fix

Backend offline suite **364 tests green** (was 349); webui `npm run build` GREEN,
no new npm deps. Additive; the spine and the 12 non-negotiables are intact
(#3 the close/escalate decision stays deterministic; #6 every LLM call through the
one gateway — the chat/reinvestigate model override is a per-call prefs copy).
Developed on the `Testing` branch.

### Fixed
- **Blank EUI icons app-wide** — icons rendered as empty gray squares because EUI
  lazy-`import()`s each glyph and those chunks don't resolve in the nginx bundle.
  Now statically pre-registered via `appendIconComponentCache` (`webui/src/lib/icons.ts`,
  128+ icons, imported first in `main.tsx`). Also fixed an invalid Cost-page icon
  (`appsApp`→`visPie`) and stale icon names elsewhere.
- **Standup never works on a degraded store** — `GET /api/standup` now always
  returns HTTP 200 with a graceful `{degraded, error}` payload instead of 500ing;
  the page renders disabled/degraded/empty states cleanly.

### Added
- **Reinvestigate a case** — `POST /api/cases/{id}/reinvestigate` re-runs the AI
  investigation (pipeline `force=True`), with an optional per-call **model** override;
  surfaced as a model-customizable button in the case flyout.
- **Ask about this case** — an in-flyout chat tab (reusable `<ChatPanel caseId/>`)
  scoped to the open case; `POST /api/chat` gained an optional `model` override.
- **Structured lifecycle actions** — `POST /api/cases/{id}/action` accepts optional
  `resolution`/`assignee`/`priority`/`tags`; the flyout actions now have icons,
  in-product explanations (tooltips), and per-action optional fields.
- **Full filtering** on Cases + Automated-scans (verdict/status/risk-range/rule/
  persona/playbook/assignee/tags/time + search; self-healing facets).
- **Redesigned Chat** — modern message bubbles, polished empty state + composer,
  per-conversation model picker; extracted a reusable `ChatPanel`.
- Shell/nav + global CSS polish (active-nav accent, health pill, hover elevation,
  focus rings, refined scrollbars; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected).

## 2026-06-23 — Browse a source's logs + read-only Test-connection & per-source TLS fixes

Backend offline suite **349 tests green** (was 340); webui `npm run build` GREEN,
no new npm deps. Additive; the spine and the 12 non-negotiables are intact.
Developed on the `Testing` branch.

### Added
- **Browse a source's logs** — `GET /api/sources/{id}/logs?limit=&query=&from=&to=`
  (auth-protected). **Pull** sources (Elasticsearch / OpenSearch / Wazuh) run a
  bounded (hard-cap **200**), read-only, field-mapping-aware scoped search honoring
  the source's own `data_view_pattern` / field mapping / TLS; **push** sources return
  the last N events from a new in-memory **live-tail ring buffer** (cap 500/source)
  in `IngestService` (or `501` if the connector does not support browse). Each row is
  `{ ts, source_ip, user, host, rule, severity, message, _raw }` — `_raw` is the full
  log document; **secrets are never returned**. `404` for an unknown source, `502`
  for a read failure.
- **`capabilities: ["browse"]`** on the pull connector manifests, auto-applied to
  every push receiver (`registry._with_browse`), so the UI shows the Logs tab only
  where it is supported.
- **webui — `SourceLogsFlyout`** — a per-source Logs panel (opened by a "Logs"
  button on each source card, gated on the connector's `browse` capability): an
  `EuiBasicTable` (timestamp · source.ip · module/rule · severity · message) with
  expandable rows showing the raw `_source` in an `EuiCodeBlock`, a search box, an
  `EuiSuperDatePicker` time range (default last 15m), and a **10s live-tail
  auto-refresh** toggle. All log content renders as plain text / code blocks
  (UNTRUSTED-safe, non-negotiable #9). `api.sourceLogs` + types added; no new deps.

### Changed / Fixed
- **Test connection now works for read-only API keys.** `ElasticConnector.test_connection()`
  no longer gates on `ping()` (a correctly-scoped read-only key cannot do `HEAD /`).
  It runs the cheap scoped read-only search **first**; HTTP 200 (any/zero hits) →
  `ok:true, mode:"read_only"` with a green *"Read-only access verified — N events
  readable in <pattern>. Cluster-monitor privilege not granted (expected for a
  read-only key)."* `ping()` is now only an extra `cluster_monitor` signal
  (`mode:"full"` when present), never the pass/fail gate; `ok:false` only when the
  scoped read fails (auth `401`/`403` on the index, or network/TLS). `ConnectionTest`
  gained `mode` + `cluster_monitor`; the webui Test-connection result renders the
  read-only / full success callout.
- **Per-source TLS is now honored.** Pull connectors previously used the global ES
  client + field-mapping config only, so a source's `es_verify_certs:false` /
  `es_ca_cert` / `es_url` / `es_api_key` never applied (observed
  `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` despite `es_verify_certs:false`). Now
  `AppState.es_client_for_source()` builds a **per-source ES client** from the
  source's merged config + secrets (dropping any global mgmt key); the primary log
  source and the browse endpoint use it, and owned clients are closed on
  rebuild/shutdown. Sources with no overrides keep using the shared global client
  (no behaviour change).

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-22 — Case explainability, RAG management & visibility, agent memory + dashboards/collaboration

Backend offline suite **340 tests green** (was 310); webui `npm run build` GREEN
(2330 modules), no new npm deps. Additive; the spine and the 12 non-negotiables are
intact. Developed on the `Testing` branch.

### Added
- **RAG ingest + management + visibility ("see the RAG")** — `engine/chunking.py`
  (`chunk_text`, a dependency-free paragraph-pack + overlap chunker); the
  `VectorStore` ABC gained `list_documents()` / `list_chunks()` / `delete_document()`
  / `stats()` (implemented in the InMemory, ES `dense_vector`, and SQL stores) — a
  "document" is the chunks sharing `metadata["document_id"]`, seeds grouped as
  `seed:<source>`. `RagService` gained `import_document(title, text, *, source, tags)`,
  `list_documents()`, `get_document(id)`, `delete_document(id, *, force)`,
  `rag_stats()`; the built-in seed sources (`runbook` / `mitre` / `suppression` /
  `resolved_case`) are **guarded against deletion unless `force=true`**. New routes:
  `GET /api/rag/stats`, `GET /api/rag/documents`, `GET /api/rag/documents/{id}`,
  `POST /api/rag/import`, `DELETE /api/rag/documents/{id}?force=`, and
  `GET /api/rag/search?q=&top_k=` (run a live retrieval to SEE what RAG returns).
  Tests: `test_rag_management.py` (11).
- **Agent memory (Claude.ai-style durable operator facts)** — `stores/memory.py`
  `MemoryStore`, backed by the existing **KVStore** (no new index or migration: ES
  via a new `EsKVStore` adapter on the config doc, SQL via `SqlKVStore`); a
  `MemoryEntry` model (`id`, `text`, `category`, `tags`, `source` (`human`|`agent`),
  `author`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `active`). Memory is auto-injected into BOTH
  automated investigations and chat as a DISTINCT **`<<<MEMORY>>>` TRUSTED block**
  (separate from the fenced UNTRUSTED evidence), with the precedence
  policy > base > playbook > MEMORY > untrusted; `prompts.render_memory()` + `fence()`
  neutralise forged `<<<MEMORY>>>` markers. **Memory NEVER overrides the deterministic
  CaseManager** — it only informs the LLM. Editing is EXPLICIT: REST
  (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/memory`, `source=human`) or conversationally in chat
  ("remember:" / "forget", `source=agent`, user-directed text only, audited). The
  chat JSON contract gained `memory_action` (executed deterministically + audited)
  and `memory_suggestion` (returned for UI confirm, never auto-saved). Tests:
  `test_memory.py` (14).
- **Case explainability** — the investigator now emits a **CONTEXT audit record**
  (new `ActionType.CONTEXT`) summarising the persona / playbook / memory / knowledge
  (RAG snippets) / enrichment it was given, and the VERDICT record carries a reasoning
  excerpt. New `GET /api/cases/{id}/rationale` assembles a pure, defensive "why"
  object: verdict / confidence / status / decision_by, persona, playbook (+ reason),
  `memory_used[]`, `knowledge[]` (RAG/runbook source + snippet), enrichment,
  `tools[]` (the commands / ES queries the agent ran), reasoning, the **DETERMINISTIC
  `decision_rationale`** (the close/escalate rationale), `mitre[]`, and `evidence[]`.
  Tests: `test_explainability.py` (5).
- **webui — Knowledge & Memory pages + the case "Why" tab** —
  - **Knowledge page** (`components/Knowledge/KnowledgePage.tsx`): RAG corpus stats
    header; import (paste textarea + `.txt`/`.md`/`.json`/`.csv` file upload read
    client-side); a documents table + chunk drill-in flyout; guarded force-delete;
    and a "Try a retrieval" search showing exactly what RAG returns. New **Platform**
    nav entry.
  - **Memory page** (`components/Memory/MemoryPage.tsx`): add / inline-edit / delete /
    active-toggle durable facts; human-vs-agent source badges; an explainer that you
    can also say "remember:" / "forget" in Chat. New **Platform** nav entry.
  - **Case "Why" tab** (`CaseDetailFlyout.tsx`): consumes `/cases/{id}/rationale` —
    the deterministic decision (prominent), agent reasoning, knowledge used (RAG /
    runbook snippets with provenance), the exact commands / queries the agent ran,
    operator memory applied, enrichment, playbook, and MITRE; plus trace-tab polish.
  - **Chat memory UI** (`ChatPage.tsx`): a calm memory-action confirmation echo + a
    dismissible "remember this?" suggestion that calls `POST /api/memory`, with a
    per-message double-save guard.

### Changed
- **Dashboards** — the Metrics page gained a "Knowledge base & memory" section (RAG
  docs/chunks, embedding model + dim, memory facts/active, corpus-by-source,
  memory-by-author); the Overview gained compact RAG/memory nav tiles. Loading is
  non-fatal.
- **Cases list collaboration** (`CasesPage.tsx`) — a sortable assignee column, tags +
  comment-count badges, and collaboration / assignee filters.
- All attacker-influenceable text (RAG chunks, memory text, tool queries, tags, chat
  suggestions) renders as plain text / `EuiCodeBlock` — never
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (non-negotiable #9 upheld). A review pass fixed one
  invalid EUI icon.

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-22 — Wave 3: metrics, feedback loop, collaboration, white-label UI + CI

Backend offline suite **310 tests green**; webui builds clean. Additive; spine
untouched. Developed on the `Testing` branch.

### Added
- **Analytics / metrics dashboard** — `engine/metrics.compute_metrics` (verdict &
  status mix, persona/playbook usage, avg risk, coarse MTTR, per-day trend) +
  `GET /api/metrics` (merges the cost ledger), surfaced as a new **Metrics** page.
- **AI-decision feedback / grading loop** — `Case.feedback` (append-only),
  `POST /api/cases/{id}/feedback`, `GET /api/feedback/stats` (agreement rate, grade
  averages, outcome mix, time saved). UI: a grading widget in the case flyout +
  a feedback-quality panel on the Metrics page. Measures triage quality / builds
  an eval corpus.
- **Case collaboration** — `Case.tags/comments/assignee`; `POST /api/cases/{id}/
  {comment,tags,assign}`; flyout UI (comments thread, tag editor, assignee) + tag
  chips/filter on the Cases list.
- **Org branding / white-label** — `BrandingConfig` (org/product name, logo upload
  as a validated base64 data URL, primary+secondary accent, theme) on Preferences;
  public `GET /api/branding` + protected `PUT`. UI: a runtime-themeable design
  system (accent via CSS vars), a Branding settings panel with live preview, and a
  branded shell + login screen.
- **Case export** — `GET /api/cases/{id}/export?format=json|md` + a flyout export
  menu (no-dep Blob download).
- **Case hover preview** — a rich, debounced, keyboard-accessible hover card on the
  Cases list / Scans board / Overview rows (verdict, risk gauge, entity, persona,
  playbook, evidence, MITRE, age).
- **CI/CD** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gates every PR on the offline backend
  suite (incl. the auth route-coverage test) + the webui build, with an aggregate
  `CI passed` check to require in branch protection (see CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Changed
- Web UI visual overhaul: skeleton loaders, `PageHeader`, KPI deltas, flat nested
  cards, inline-markdown chat, hero numbers, copy/print, capped badge rows, page
  fade-ins, `prefers-reduced-motion` support. Fixed the dead Scans card click and
  the Cases stat-tile/total mismatch.

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-21 — Wave 2: Markdown playbooks + optional auth

Backend offline suite **300 tests green**; webui builds clean. Additive; the spine
(typed OCSF, StateStore, one LLM gateway, durable cursor) is untouched.

### Added
- **Markdown playbook engine** (`backend/app/playbooks/` + `backend/playbooks/*.md`):
  operator-authored phased procedures with strict-validated YAML front-matter
  (`PlaybookManifest`), a deterministic, explainable `PlaybookRegistry.select`
  (rule_ids / entity_types / min_event_count are hard criteria; mitre/tags are
  advisory — clusters carry no MITRE pre-investigation), atomic hot-reload, and the
  matched playbook injected as a DISTINCT `<<<PLAYBOOK>>>` TRUSTED block separate
  from the fenced UNTRUSTED evidence (+ a precedence line). It can only RECOMMEND.
  3 seed playbooks (brute-force login, suspicious outbound, reported phishing).
  Endpoints: `GET /api/playbooks`, `POST /api/playbooks/reload`,
  `GET /api/playbooks/selection/{case_id}`. `Case.playbook_id` + audit record the
  selection/fallback. A playbook's `rag_queries` augment retrieval (bounded by top_k).
- **Optional auth (default OFF — the no-auth "old version" remains the default and
  fully available)**: stdlib-only `app/auth/` (PBKDF2 password hashing + HS256 JWT)
  + `app/middleware/` (security headers / CSRF / Redis-free rate limit); a
  router-level `require_auth` gate that is a strict no-op when disabled, with a tiny
  `PUBLIC_API_PATHS` allowlist; `/api/auth/{login,me,logout}`; and a CI
  route-coverage test that fails if any `/api` route bypasses auth.
- webui: an optional login gate (no-op when auth is off) + a read-only
  **Playbooks & Agents** catalog surface.

### Changed
- **Case Manager → operator-configurable `AutoClosePolicy`** (`engine/case_manager.decide`
  is now a pure fn over `(verdict, confidence, risk_score, policy)`): per-verdict-class
  enable / min-confidence / max-risk / objection-window. FALSE_POSITIVE auto-closes
  above a bar by default; **TRUE_POSITIVE auto-close is an explicit opt-in (off by
  default)**; **NEEDS_HUMAN never auto-closes (code-enforced)**. The deprecated
  `fp_auto_close` is migrated into `auto_close.false_positive` for stored configs.
  (This generalises the old "a TP is never auto-closed" invariant into a tunable,
  code-enforced policy — see CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #3.)
- Runbooks are now the RAG **knowledge** corpus only; per-cluster procedure
  injection is owned by the new playbook system.

## Development snapshot — 2026-06-21 — Vigil-inspired overhaul (Wave 1) + plugin archived

A deep end-to-end study of the open-source **Vigil** AI-SOC (10 Opus research
agents; see `docs/VIGIL_STUDY.md`) drove an additive overhaul that keeps our
spine (typed OCSF, `StateStore`, the single LLM gateway, deterministic case
manager) fully intact. Backend offline suite: **244 tests green**; webui builds
clean (`tsc` + Vite).

### Added
- **Multi-agent roster** (`backend/app/agents/personas.py`): a declarative
  `AgentPersona` registry (identity / web-app / network-recon / malware /
  threat-intel + generalist) over the ONE investigator. The cluster is routed to a
  specialist deterministically; the persona specialises the system prompt and is
  recorded on the case + audit. `GET /api/personas`. Surfaced as a badge on the
  case-detail flyout.
- **Plain-text runbooks** (`backend/app/runbooks/*.md` + `engine/runbooks.py`):
  Markdown playbooks with frontmatter, selected per cluster and injected as TRUSTED
  guidance into the investigator, and indexed into the RAG corpus. `GET /api/runbooks`.
- **Hybrid RAG retrieval** (`tools/rag.py`): drawer-floor-first vector search +
  dependency-free BM25 re-ranking — recovers exact IOC/rule tokens that embed as
  noise. Toggle `rag.hybrid` (default on).
- **Tool safety tiers** (`constants.ToolTier` + `tools/base.py`): safe / managed /
  requires_approval / forbidden capability firewall; the investigator gates
  non-safe tools (proposes them for human approval, never auto-executes).
- **Cost provenance** (`llm/pricing.py`): `pricing_source` (exact / heuristic /
  zero / default) + a tier-prefix price heuristic, threaded onto every `UsageDoc`.

### Changed
- **Hardened untrusted-data fencing** (`agents/prompts.py` `fence()`): neutralises
  forged close-markers and carries `source=`/`tool=` provenance (non-negotiable #9).
- **Archived the legacy Kibana plugin** → `archive/kibana-plugin/` (history
  preserved). The standalone webui is now the sole supported surface.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-21 — Vendor-agnostic, self-hosted agentic SOC

The project transitions from an ELK/Kibana-coupled triage suite into an
**open-source, self-hosted, vendor-agnostic agentic SOC**. It now ingests from any
SIEM/EDR/XDR, normalises everything to OCSF, and ships its own standalone web UI —
the Kibana plugin becomes legacy/optional. Backend offline suite: **221 tests
green**; standalone web UI builds clean (`tsc` + Vite).

### Added

- **OCSF canonical schema** (`backend/app/ocsf/`). Every record, whatever its
  origin, is normalised to OCSF (with an ECS→OCSF mapping) before the engine
  reasons over it.
- **Connector SPI + registry** (`backend/app/connectors/`). A `PullConnector` /
  `PushReceiver` SPI, a process-wide registry, and a `tlsoc.connectors`
  entry-point group so out-of-tree connectors install via `pip` and appear in the
  wizard with zero core change.
- **PULL connectors — Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Wazuh.** Poll an ES-API-compatible
  search API on a durable cursor (Wazuh reads the OpenSearch-based Wazuh indexer);
  per-source field mapping is set in the wizard.
- **16 PUSH / queue / object-store receivers + push runtime.** webhook, Splunk-HEC,
  syslog, Kafka, AWS SQS, AWS Kinesis, Azure Event Hub, GCP Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ,
  NATS, MQTT, Redis Streams, S3, GCS, Azure Blob, file. Formats parsed:
  JSON / NDJSON / CEF / LEEF / GELF / syslog / kv; optional client libs imported
  lazily (no new hard dependency). HTTP push lands via `POST /api/ingest/{source_id}`;
  syslog/queue/object-store receivers run as background receivers; all flow into the
  same `correlate → risk → cost-gate → LLM → case` pipeline the poller feeds.
- **Per-source secrets.** `POST /api/sources/{id}/secrets` stores secret field
  values in the in-memory secret tier (never persisted); only the field NAMES are
  recorded on the source.
- **Multi-source wizard backend.** `GET /api/connectors` (+ `/{source_type}`) lists
  every connector and its auth/config field schema; `GET|POST|DELETE /api/sources`
  and `POST /api/connectors/test` add, update, remove, mark-primary, and test
  sources.
- **SQL StateStore** (`backend/app/stores/sql/`). `STATE_BACKEND` selects where the
  app's OWN state (cases/audit/usage/config/cursor/RAG) lives: `elasticsearch`
  (default), `postgres` (asyncpg + pgvector), or `sqlite`. With postgres/sqlite, no
  Elasticsearch is required at all.
- **Standalone web UI + first-run wizard** (`webui/`, Vite + React +
  `@elastic/eui`). The new primary front door: a self-hosted SPA talking to the
  backend directly over `/api`, with a multi-step setup wizard (connector picker +
  dynamic per-connector form + connection test, LLM providers + per-role models,
  enrichment/detection defaults), a sources manager, and full Preferences editing.
- **Deploy artifacts.** `deploy/docker-compose.agnostic.yml` — a self-contained
  stack (Postgres+pgvector + Redis + backend + web UI; open http://localhost:8080,
  add the SIEM in the wizard) — plus a web UI container image (`webui/Dockerfile`).

### Changed

- **Kibana plugin is now legacy/optional.** The standalone `webui/` replaces it as
  the primary UI; the plugin and the legacy `deploy/docker-compose.tlsoc.yml`
  (merge-into-ELK) path remain for existing ELK deployments.

## Development snapshot — pre-standardized work-order cycle

Work-order cycle (live status in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); session notes in
[`Journal.md`](Journal.md)). 8.19.12 zip rebuilt + verified; backend
`pytest -q` = 124 passed; plugin `tsc` clean. (Offline-verified only — there is no
live-stack validation this cycle.)

### Case detail flyout + unified cards + Settings nav (done)
- **Click-to-open now opens a right-side flyout** (`case_detail_flyout.tsx`) over any
  surface — no more scrolling to a detail panel at the bottom. The flyout has a header
  (entity + verdict/status/risk/confidence), tabs (Overview · Agent trace · History ·
  Ask) and a sticky footer with the contextual lifecycle actions + Re-investigate.
- **One unified case card** (`case_card.tsx`) and **one grid** (`case_grid.tsx`) now back
  Investigate, Automated Scans, and the Board: a severity-banded accent, a prominent
  (restrained) risk number, verdict/status chips, hover + selected states.
- **Grid controls:** a KPI strip, a sort control (risk/date), a filter popover
  (status · risk band · verdict) with removable active-filter chips, and an auto-filling
  responsive grid that fills the width. Shared case logic lives in `lib/cases.ts`.
- **Settings** now uses a **left section navigation** (all sub-sections listed on the
  left, the selected section on the right) instead of an accordion stack — every field
  preserved.
- **Full-width layout** (`restrictWidth={false}`) across the app to use the previously
  wasted horizontal space; a `casesVersion` signal keeps the grids in sync after a
  lifecycle change in the flyout. Removed the superseded inline `case_detail.tsx`.

### UI redesign — shared design system + every surface (done)
- **New shared design system.** `public/lib/format.ts` (date/money/number/percent
  formatters + `humanizeToken`) and `public/components/ui.tsx` (the single
  `COLORS` palette + `tint()`; `verdict/status/risk` colour helpers; reusable
  `SectionHeader`, `StatTile`, `EmptyState`, and `RiskBadge`/`VerdictBadge`/
  `StatusBadge`/`ConfidenceBadge`); plus layout utilities in `public/index.scss`
  (`tlsocIconChip`, `tlsocStatTile`, `tlsocCard`, `tlsocBoard__*`). No new deps.
- **Case Board** now usable: a **visible drag handle** AND a per-card actions menu
  (Open / Close / Escalate / Reopen) — both routed through the same confirm flow —
  fix the "can't move the cards" problem; columns sit in a horizontal scroll lane
  with coloured headers; cards carry a verdict/status accent + shared badges.
- **Investigate ("Security Investigation")** rebuilt to a supplied reference design:
  an IP/user/host search bar (`EuiFieldSearch`), an **Active Cases** 3-column card
  grid (ENTITY/RISK/RULES/CREATED with a prominent colour-coded risk number and a
  status pill), Refresh + a functional **Filters** popover, and a tall "Select a case
  to begin Agentic Triage" prompt that swaps to the case detail + follow-up chat on
  selection. A subtle global footer was added to the app shell. Uses the previously
  wasted horizontal/vertical space.
- **Automated Scans** rebuilt from a plain table into a KPI strip + a responsive
  card grid (entity icon, shared verdict/status/risk/confidence badges, formatted
  timestamps, Open / Reproduce / Why-this-fired) with a proper empty state.
- **Cost & Tokens** rebuilt into KPI tiles + weighted breakdown cards (proportional
  bars), a tidy dependency-free cost-over-time list, and a resilient top-cost-driver
  table.
- **Settings** visually refreshed (section header, accented section icons,
  `EuiHealth` credential status) with **every field and handler unchanged**.
- **App shell** — page-header description, per-tab icons + clearer nomenclature
  (Chat / Investigate / Case Board / Automated Scans / Standup / Cost & Tokens /
  Settings), wider layout. **Standup / Investigate / Case detail / Verdict card**
  adopt the shared badges + headers for a consistent console.
- Behaviour, data contracts, and the backend↔plugin API are unchanged — this is a
  presentation-only pass over the existing surfaces.

### Cycle 2 — bug fixes (done)
- **BUG-1 — chat does a real 2-turn analysis.** Turn 1 only chooses the query
  (before any rows exist); after the `es_query` runs, the engine re-prompts over a
  **compact, fenced-UNTRUSTED aggregate** of the results (top facets + time span +
  a few sample rows, never the raw dump) so chat shows analysis, not just a
  "fetching logs" preamble + table. Degrades to the turn-1 answer + row-count
  summary on any model error; both turns are metered (`agents/chat.py`,
  `prompts.CHAT_SYSTEM`).
- **BUG-2 — investigate no longer 400s on a fixed `now-24h` window.** New
  `Preferences.investigate_lookback` + per-request `InvestigateRequest.lookback` +
  an auto-widen ladder (configured → `now-7d` → `now-30d` → `now-365d`); the
  frontend renders a **neutral empty-state** ("No events found …") instead of a
  red error.
- **BUG-3 — the Standup tab no longer blanks.** `aggregate.cases` is now an object
  (`{ opened, by_status, by_verdict }`); the FE renders the opened tile +
  by-verdict / by-status tables, wrapped in an **error boundary**.
- **BUG-4 — header chat button contrast.** The global chat button is a native
  `EuiHeaderSectionItemButton` (correct light/dark contrast).
- **BUG-5 — correlation over a sliding look-back window.** Correlation now runs
  over the widest configured rule window (plus a margin, never less than a poll
  interval), not just the incremental poll batch, so a real-time burst spread
  across more than one poll interval still reaches its threshold
  (`engine/poller.py`).
- **IMPROVEMENT — manual-investigation provenance.** Manual investigations get a
  synthesized `TriggerReason` ("Why this fired"), a preserved `origin_surface`, and
  a normalized `reproduce_query`.

### Cycle 3 — features (done)
- **C3-1 — config-driven rule catalog.** `Preferences.rule_catalog` of
  `RuleDefinition { name, enabled, match{field,op,value}, correlation,
  model_override, priority }`; seeds the 13 real `event.module` rules + 5
  ModSec sub-rules (`modsec_xss`/`sqli`/`lfi`/`rce`/`scanner` by `rule.id` prefix,
  lower priority) into `tlsoc-agent-config` on first run. **Version-guarded** —
  never clobbers operator edits. Editable in Settings; this is how XSS-specific
  triggering is enabled.
- **C3-2 — Board tab.** A drag-and-drop Kanban of cases
  (Open · Needs human (escalated) · Closed); a drag maps to `close` / `reopen` /
  `escalate`.
- **C3-3 — agent trace.** `GET /api/cases/{id}/trace` + an "Agent trace" timeline
  on the case detail (router / investigator / tool-calls / verdict / formatter /
  case-manager, projected from `tlsoc-agent-audit`). `prefs.trace.include_prompts`
  gates whether prompt excerpts are returned.
- **C3-4 — re-investigate a stored case.** `POST /api/cases/{id}/investigate` + an
  Investigate button on stored cases; re-runs the agent in place (`force=True`),
  preserving provenance.
- **C3-5 — resolved-case RAG baseline.** Closing / confirm-FP indexes the case
  (entity + rules + verdict + risk + analyst note + trigger reason) into the
  resolved-case RAG store; the close modal has a note textarea; future
  investigations see a "Prior analyst decisions (baseline)" block. Gated by
  `rag.enabled` + `rag.use_resolved_cases`; fail-safe.
- **C3-6 — expanded model catalog + per-rule models.** Added OpenAI
  `gpt-4.1` / `gpt-4.1-mini` / `gpt-4-turbo` / `gpt-4` / `o4-mini` / `gpt-5` /
  `gpt-5-mini` to `pricing.py` (operator-verifiable approximate prices) + per-model
  param quirks (`gpt-5`/o-series omit `temperature`, use `max_completion_tokens`) +
  per-rule model overrides (`Preferences.rule_model_override`; `model_for_rule`
  precedence: `RuleDefinition.model_override` → `rule_model_override` → per-role)
  with a Settings table.
- **C3-7 — merged case history timeline.** The case history is now a merged,
  de-duplicated `EuiCommentList` timeline.

### Added (prior cycle — done)
- **Feature 1 — Global header chat button + context-aware flyout.** `plugin.ts`
  registers `core.chrome.navControls.registerRight`; `global_chat_control` +
  `global_chat_flyout` reuse the Chat engine; `lib/screen_context.ts` snapshots
  app/data-view/time-range/query/selection at send time; backend `ChatContext` /
  `ChatRequest.context`, fenced as UNTRUSTED and used only as es_query defaults.
- **Feature 2 — Per-log "AI overview".** Discover doc-viewer tab ("TLSOC AI
  Overview", guarded `unifiedDocViewer` registration) + in-app per-row overview
  button; backend `POST /api/overview` single-event agent on the cheap
  `overview_model`, metered through the gateway, reusing IP enrichment.
- **Feature 3 — "Why was this triggered".** `TriggerReason` (deterministic matched
  window + human sentence) carried onto every case and rendered in scans + case
  detail; case index-template priority raised to 600.
- **Feature 4 — Comprehensive settings + per-task model selection.** `settings.tsx`
  renders EVERY `Preferences` field; per-role model pickers from `GET /api/models`.
- **RAG (P1).** `use_resolved_cases` retrievable memory; ES `dense_vector` kNN
  store behind the `VectorStore` ABC; mixed-embedding-space guard (clear+reseed,
  no truncation); min-cosine threshold; richer query; chat grounded in RAG.

### Deferred
- **Feature 5 — wizard rewrite.** The original 4-step wizard is functional; the
  enhancement (dataViews create, auto-suggest, per-role models) is best validated
  against a live 8.19 Kibana. Tracked in ROADMAP.

### Changed (done this cycle)
- **P0 — Case detail + lifecycle in the UI.** Selected case lifted into app
  state; case-detail rehydrates via `GET /api/cases/{id}`; table rows open the
  stored case (no re-investigate); `VerdictCard` lifecycle controls →
  `POST /api/cases/{id}/action`.
- **P1 — Case/verdict stability + provenance.** Don't re-run the LLM pipeline on
  an already-investigated open case every attach; preserve original surface;
  keep verdict history.
- **P2 — Risk/verdict correctness.** CIDR asset tagging; velocity edge case;
  enforce `caps.timeout_seconds` in the investigator loop; normalize
  `reproduce_query` syntax.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-16

Phase-1 POC of the agentic SOC triage suite — a read-only consumer alongside the
TrustLab / IIT Bombay ELK pipeline.

### Added
- **Backend (FastAPI + LangGraph) — the full agentic spine.** Durable-cursor
  polling → deterministic correlation → deterministic risk scoring → cost gate →
  cheap router → strong investigator (ReAct) → formatter → deterministic Case
  Manager (close/escalate; a TRUE_POSITIVE is never auto-closed). Tools:
  `es_query` (read-only logs), `enrich` (Redis-cached AbuseIPDB/VirusTotal),
  `rag_retrieve`. One LLM gateway with a usage/cost ledger for every call.
- **Two-scoped-key Elasticsearch model.** Physically separate read-only
  (`all-logs-*`) and management (`tlsoc-agent-*`) clients; never `kibana_system`
  or the superuser at runtime (`es/client.py`).
- **The suite's own indices:** `tlsoc-agent-{cases,audit,usage}-*` plus the
  single-doc `tlsoc-agent-config` and `tlsoc-agent-cursor`.
- **Append-only audit trail** and **prompt-injection fencing seam** (all
  log-derived values wrapped as UNTRUSTED data).
- **Kibana plugin (React + EUI)** — five surfaces (Chat, Investigate/Alerts,
  Automated Scans, Daily Standup, Cost) plus Settings/Wizard; a thin viewer that
  talks to the backend only through the Kibana server-side proxy `/api/tlsoc/*`.
- **Plugin artifact for Kibana 8.12.2** (`plugin/dist/tlsocAgenticTriage-8.12.2.zip`)
  and bundled saved-object dashboards (Audit + Cost & Tokens).
- **Deploy assets** — `deploy/docker-compose.tlsoc.yml`, index-template mappings,
  dashboards; `.env.example`.
- **Offline test suite** (fake ES + mock LLM) — 49 backend tests green.

### Security
- Applied a security/correctness review pass over the backend (commit
  `942bc49`): scoped-key separation, fail-to-human on every error path, and the
  prompt-injection fencing seam.

## [Plugin build 8.19.12] — 2026-06-16

- **Built the plugin for Kibana 8.19.12** from the single source tree
  (`plugin/dist/tlsocAgenticTriage-8.19.12.zip`), keeping the 8.12.2 artifact.
  Portability via `@kbn/*` import aliases + `--kibana-version` stamping; legacy
  `kibana.json` manifest; Node 22.22.0, no bazel. No backend or contract change
  between versions (`COMPATIBILITY.md`).

## [Docs] — 2026-06-16

- **Exhaustive build/deploy/usage/troubleshooting guides** (commit `585647b`):
  `plugin/BUILD.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `docs/USAGE.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`,
  `COMPATIBILITY.md`.
- **Coordination & context docs** (commit `a9db0af`): `CLAUDE.md` (master
  context), `Journal.md` (work diary), `ROADMAP.md` (live work tracking),
  `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` (the two environments).
